    "content": "There are many successful managers who have the skills and expertise to drive results and achieve success in their roles. However, not all of these managers are able to transition from successful managers to great leaders.\nHere are five reasons why so many successful managers fail to become great leaders:\nLack of vision: Great leaders are able to set a clear direction and inspire others to follow. On the other hand, successful managers provide the details for direction. If you get stuck as a manager and don’t rise above the details to have a clear vision, you will fail to become a great leader.\nIneffective coaching: Great leaders are able to help their team members solve problems. However, successful managers tend to give answers rather than help their team find solutions. If you are unable to coach others as a manager, you will fail to become a great leader.\nLack of people development: Great leaders understand the importance of investing in their team’s development and providing opportunities for growth and advancement. On the other hand, successful managers prioritize projects over people. If you get stuck on concentrating only on project and forgo developing your people, you will fail to become a great leader.\nRelying too much on giving answers: Great leaders value asking questions, seek input and foster collaboration. However, successful managers pride themselves on having answers. To become a great leader, you must be willing to ask questions and seek input from your team, otherwise you will fail to become a great leader.\nInability to inspire: Great leaders are able to inspire their team to achieve greatness. On the other hand, successful managers are more comfortable with comforting rather than inspiring. To become a great leader, you must be able to inspire and motivate your team, otherwise you fail to become a great leader.\nSuccessful managers who fail to become great leaders may struggle to pivot their mindset and develop the skills necessary for leadership. To succeed in becoming a great leader, it’s important to address areas such as vision, coaching, people development, asking questions, and inspiring. By developing these traits, managers can make the transition to becoming great leaders.\nLead From Within: Great leadership is not about achieving individual success, but rather about empowering and inspiring others to achieve success as a team.\n#1 N A T I O N A L B E S T S E L L E R\nThe Leadership Gap\nWhat Gets Between You and Your Greatness\nAfter decades of coaching powerful executives around the world, Lolly Daskal has observed that leaders rise to their positions relying on a specific set of values and traits. But in time, every executive reaches a point when their performance suffers and failure persists.

The one thing you can upgrade to have the greatest impact on your win rates, deal size, sales cycles, and overall performance?\nIt’s not more efficient prospecting. It’s not more pipeline activity. It’s not stronger sales process, more effective strategy, or even a better CRM. And if you think I’m going to say “coaching your salespeople,” you’re wrong.\nAll of those can help. All of them are critically important to effective sales. But they’re not the largest critical multiplier. No, not even sales coaching.\nThere’s another lever that’s even more critical. It requires you to take a step back to see one level higher than coaching your salespeople.\nWe all know that coaching is a great sales multiplier. But how do you get great coaching? By coaching your coaches.\nThat’s the biggest lever.\nMost sales organizations make a lot of mistakes in how they manage sales management.\n- They promote their best salespeople into managers\n- They fail to vet prospective managers for correct mindset\n- They don’t invest in providing training and resources to help new managers succeed\n- They invest in salesperson training, without engaging the sales managers to ensure that they can coach the new skills and behaviors\n- They force managers to “manage by lagging indicators”\n- They don’t provide enough time, space, analytics, or training for managers to coach each individual salesperson to achieve their best performance\nThe result is a snarl of ineffective sales management that leaves salespeople largely on their own to sink or swim, and fails to provide the effectiveness boost that truly excellent sales management is capable of.\n- Organizations can do better at sales management by\n- Improving the way they promote sales managers\n- Improving the way they onboard sales managers\n- Putting an effective coaching framework into place\n- Making sure coaches have TIME to spend with salespeople\n- Instituting effective cadences\n- Equipping coaches with analytics that help them see where coaching is needed\n- Embed training and enablement so salespeople can self-serve the basics and access coaching when they really need it\nBut none of this is going to matter if your sales managers aren’t all that great at coaching.\nJust as salespeople aren’t born knowing how to sell, sales coaches aren’t born knowing how to coach. Often, the wrong people are promoted to the job, but even when it’s the right person, they still don’t always have the skills. The right person may:\n- Have a collaboration mindset\n- Care more about the team than their own individual performance\n- Care about their team’s personal and professional growth and success\n- Have excellent sales skills in their own right\n- Understand your way of selling\nBut knowing how to do it is not the same as knowing how to coach it. That’s why the highest performing athletes don’t always make the highest performing coaches.\nJust as salespeople aren’t born knowing how to sell, sales coaches aren’t born knowing how to coach.\nTo coach the coach, you need to invest in professional training, enablement, and external coaching to ensure your coaches are continually improving their coaching game. They need to know how to:\n- execute your WAY of selling, including your strategy, process, methodology, playbooks, and conversational skills\n- coach others in your way of selling\n- coach people to personal growth and success\n- ask great coaching questions\n- know when someone needs more help\n- prioritize their attention to leverage their coaching most effectively\n- build cadences that work for the people on their team\n- have difficult conversations\n- motivate and inspire rather than just manage\n- access additional resources when they need them to support their work and their team\nBy pumping up your management team’s coaching skills, you multiply their multiplier. One way to do this is to hire a professional sales consultant, such as one of Membrain’s partners, to help you build an effective coaching system and then coach your coaches to their highest potential.

    "content": "As a leader, your communication skills can make or break the success of your team and organization. Great leaders know that effective communication is key to building trust, aligning efforts towards common goals, and inspiring positive change. On the other hand, poor communication can lead to misunderstandings, damaged relationships, and barriers to progress. That’s why it’s so important to focus on developing your communication skills as a leader.\nHere are 5 strategies that can help transform your leadership:\nAuthenticity matters: Great leaders understand that being genuine and authentic is essential to building trust and creating meaningful connections with their team. When you are authentic, you are showing your team that you are genuine and transparent, and this can help build a strong foundation of trust and respect.\nListening is powerful: Good leaders know that listening is a powerful communication tool. When you listen to your team, you show them that you value their input and ideas. Thus, you create an environment where everyone feels heard and respected.\nVulnerability is the new strong: Great leaders understand that vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness. When you are open and honest about your own challenges and struggles. Consequently, you create a culture of vulnerability and authenticity within your team, which can lead to stronger connections and more effective communication.\nOpen-ended questions fosters insight: As a leader, it’s important to ask open-ended questions to encourage dialogue and get to the root of your team’s concerns and ideas. Some examples of open-ended questions include: “Tell me more,” “Explain what you mean,” and “Define that term or concept for me.” These open-ended questions can foster critical thinking and deeper insights.\nEmpathy empowers: Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. When you demonstrate empathy as a leader, you show your team that you care about them, you are willing to put yourself in their shoes. This can help create a strong sense of connection and trust within your team, leading to more effective communication and collaboration.\nEffective communication is essential for leaders. By implementing key strategies you can transform your leadership and inspire positive change in your team. Take the time to understand and utilize these foundational communication techniques, and you will see the benefits in both your personal and professional relationships.\nLead From Within: The most powerful leadership tool you have is your communication. How you use it can be transformative.\nOf Lolly’s many awards and accolades, Lolly was designated a Top-50 Leadership and Management Expert by Inc. magazine.

    "domain": "leaderonomics.com",
    "age": "1,004 days ago",
    "content": "Hiring well is a niche skill that tech founders need to develop if they want their organisation to succeed.\nThe tech world moves at an alarming rate, so it stands to reason that tech founders – and their talent – need to operate in a way that means they can anticipate new changes and react to unexpected developments at speed.\nRecent months have seen mass layoffs for the big tech companies such as Meta, Amazon, Apple and Salesforce were among the most at-risk during the process. These layoffs may have been a surprise to the industry, especially as in 2022, the biggest challenge was addressing the huge talent gap, with too few qualified people to fill an abundance of tech jobs. However, these layoffs are not representative of the overall industry, with demand for talent to fill tech jobs remaining at a high. It is, therefore, more important than ever that founders master the skill of hiring – and keeping- talent.\nIn most cases, the future success of a startup can be predicted by the strength of the early team. Knowing who to hire, who can be developed, and who will be with you for the longer term will enable you to build a capable, cohesive team that enables you to take on the challenges that you will inevitably face. Conversely, if you make the wrong decisions in your early days, you will lose time and money that you most likely can’t afford to lose at a critical phase of your development.\nA strong organisation is made up of a variety of people. But when it comes to creating your core team as a start up, you need to make sure that your recruits fit your culture in every way, without compromise. If you fail to hire people that share your company’s beliefs and values at an early stage, you risk losing sight of your company’s identity.\nYour people are your future\nWhen hiring for a startup, it is essential that you get a team of people who understand your vision and are equipped to support it. As a startup, investment is going to mean the difference between success and failure and your investors. And it is not necessarily your idea that they will invest in – no matter how great it is. Investors invest in people. Prove that you have a good team around you, and you are much more likely to get the investment that you need, when you need it.\nFoundations for growth\nYou don’t need to recruit directors from the start; a skilled hirer can spot raw talent and see how potential staff members will feed into the career pipeline in the future. An administrator may be your head of operations in five years’ time; your software developer may become a manager or even director in time. By hiring the right people from the start, you will have a solid team around you which you can develop as your needs evolve.\nReputation development\nNo matter how great your benefits are, if you have a reputation as a bad organisation to work for, you have high turnover, it is going to be increasingly hard for you to attract the right people. By taking the time to hire well, you are more likely to hire once.\nWhile anyone can hire new talent, hiring well is a niche skill and one that it is essential for tech founders to develop if they want their organisation to be a success. For many organisations, it can be beneficial for founders to play to their strengths and find a tech or a global recruitment agency that understands their values and can take the lead on recruitment so that the founders can focus on their core purpose and build a successful company.\nBe sure to check out the media below:\nLeaderonomics.com is an advertisement-free website.

Unplanned IT disruptions can cause major downtime, resulting in lost revenue, decreased or halted productivity, and lost customer trust. Since many tech breakdowns can be avoided when issues are handled in the early stages, tech support is a necessary component in your business continuity plan.\nIn this article, we’ll explore the role of dependable tech support in maintaining uninterrupted business operations.\nFirst, let’s establish why it’s crucial to avoid downtime.",

    "content": "From Politeness to Partnership: Embracing Conflict Drives Effective Collaboration\nMany organisations I’ve come across tend to save one area for last while exploring new ways of working: conflict engagement. You could compare this approach to neglecting car maintenance, only to regret the decision when it breaks down. However, this analogy may create negative connotations around conflict, suggesting that it should be managed or avoided. Instead, I believe that conflict should be embraced and even leaned into. Here's why!\nWhat Research says: Group Development and Stages\nDecades of group development research (such as the large body of work done by Susan Wheelan) shows that groups need to go through stages to reach what we might call ‘high performance.’ There is no avoiding these stages, it is simply a function of being a bunch of social creatures who take time to trust each other and work efficiently together.\nIn the first stage, ‘Inclusion and Dependency’, we are sussing out if we belong, wondering: “Am I accepted? Am I included?” The atmosphere is something like a cocktail party where conversation is surface-level, polite, and tentative. People are looking to the leader for answers.\nIf we successfully resolve most of the inclusion issues, the second stage is called ‘Counterdependency and Fighting,’ where disagreements emerge about the group’s task and goals. At this stage, people start challenging and questioning one another, leading to the first conflicts that arise.\nThe Prison of Pretence\nWhen conflicts arise, we tend to either argue and try to win or avoid (consciously or unconsciously) the conflict altogether by trying to be professional and polite and get on with things. However, tiptoeing around conflicts consumes significant amounts of energy that could otherwise be directed towards innovation, problem solving, and creating value.\nMy colleague Karin Tenelius calls this phenomenon the 'Prison of Pretence', where many groups get stuck, like Sisyphus pushing a rock up a hill. This prevents us from reaching higher levels of trust and cooperation needed to be a truly effective team.\nAnd let’s not underestimate the emotional toll of this as Susan Wheelan notes in her book Creating Effective Teams, “You know you’re in a Stage 2 group when the thought of going to a team meeting makes you feel ill.”\nBut if we can learn to engage with conflicts, and see the gold on the other side of them, we can move to the next two stages of group development. In Stage 3, we begin to create clarity and structures to become an effective team, and we foster positive relationships.\nVery few groups (about one in four) ever reach Stage 4, where groups achieve high trust and efficiency, leading to the magic 'high performance' realm. Note that in both these stages, conflicts happen frequently. The difference is, the group knows how to handle them effectively and quickly transform them.\nTips to Upgrade Conflict Navigation\n1. Practise Relationship Conversations\nRelationships are a fractal of the groups we are part of so it is valuable to tend to them, like plants in a greenhouse. The Harvard Business Review authors, Kerry Roberts Gibson and Beth Schinoff, suggest that relationships in the workplace are not fixed and can be improved with effort:\n“Most people see coworker relationships as being fixed: Good ones will always remain happy, and bad ones will never get better. Consequently, we take our healthy relationships for granted [...and we] write off those that have soured, instead of taking steps to improve them. This, too, is misguided, because coworker relationships are actually fluid: Even the most toxic ones can be repaired, and the most positive can quickly spiral downward.”\nAt Tuff Leadership Training, we practise (and train others in) a conversation called a ‘Pebbles Conversation,’ to maintain healthy relationships. The conversation aims to address discomfort or misunderstandings early on, before they become bigger issues that can affect the relationship. To maintain healthy relationships, it's important to have a \"clean system\" where we're not constantly second-guessing the intentions or actions of others. This can be compared to having a pebble in our shoe - it may not bother us at first, but the longer we ignore it, the more uncomfortable and painful it becomes.\nFor example, the other week my colleague Kajsa asked if she could bring up a pebble with me. This question still makes my heart race, but I knew it was important to address and, like broccoli, it would be good for me. Kajsa shared that my tone in a previous Slack message came across as a bit demanding and insensitive, making her feel like I was not an equal partner in improving our website but more like a 'rockstar'. This was affecting our relationship, and she wanted to work on it.\nShe acknowledged that she believed it was not my intention to come across this way and that I may not have been aware of it. Rather than justifying or explaining myself, I actively listened to her concerns, apologized, and we agreed on a plan to be more mindful of our communication in the future. As part of this plan, Kajsa suggested a codeword, \"rockstar,\" to help me recognize, lovingly, when I was at it again.\nIn my personal life, my partner and I try to have regular ‘Relationship Retrospectives’, inspired by this blog by Alanna Irving. Creating an intentional space to talk about ‘the relationship’ makes it so much easier to talk about sensitive issues because it’s in the context of having a better relationship and crucially not about ‘being right.’\n2. Transform your Groups: Building Trust and Openness\n“Psychological safety is not the same as psychological comfort.” If we want to have effective teams, we need to find ways to be radically honest with each other and talk about what’s ‘under the surface’ – in other words, feelings, ways of being, mindsets, relationship dynamics, working climate, and so on.\nThe first step is to stop being polite, stop pretending, and stop protecting! We are adults, capable human beings who can talk about things that are difficult to talk about.\nIn Tuff, we use the metaphor of putting our ‘moose heads on the table’. It’s a way of referring to the usually taboo issues that affect the level of trust and collaboration in the team. We start every meeting with the question: “Any moose heads?” Someone might bring one up (perhaps about something that was done or said in the previous meeting) and the group will listen to them and ask them what they need – an explanation? An apology? Perhaps just to feel heard and acknowledged. It’s never ‘comfortable’, but every time we do this, it’s a joint commitment to having a climate of openness and trust.\nConclusion: Embracing Conflict for True Collaboration\nIf we want our groups to get out of the ‘Prison of Pretence’ and reach the highest level of true collaboration, one key area to develop is our ability to engage with conflicts. We can do that by:\n- Seeing conflicts as generative (if we don’t put a lid on them, and if we learn how to navigate them)\n- Practising relationship conversations (maintaining healthy one-to-one relationships is part of having a healthy group)\n- Transforming our groups (by daring to be much more honest and open about what’s really going on under the surface in order to free up energy for being an effective team)\nDive Deeper\nIf you're looking for more insights from the world's most pioneering firms, make sure you get a free copy of our PDF guide.

    "content": "Here are 5 Proven Practices to Boost Psychological Safety\nThere’s certainly been a ton of talk about the concept of psychological safety over the last few years. However, most of that talk seems to revolve primarily around the definition of the concept rather than about how to bring the concept into practice. Fortunately, we’re here to help! Here are five practices you can experiment with to foster a safe working environment.\nHave you ever been lucky enough to be part of a team that just clicks? A team where everyone is on the same page and things just seem to flow smoothly? It's an incredible feeling, so it's no coincidence that those teams are often the most successful.\nHowever, building a great team that delivers excellent teamwork is about much more than talented individuals. This works pretty much the same way with sports: talent is obviously a priority, but it can only get you so far.\nBut what makes the team truly great if it is not about the talent of individuals?\nGreat teamwork requires psychological safety\nOne key factor is something called psychological safety. And while it may sound complicated, it’s essentially about creating a safe and supportive environment where team members feel comfortable speaking up and sharing their ideas.\nAmazing things can happen when people feel safe to be themselves and contribute to the team. In fact, research has shown that teams with high levels of psychological safety are more innovative, more productive, and more likely to retain their members.\nCheck out the animation below to learn more:\n5 proven practices to foster psychological safety\nSo, if you want to create the best team to produce great teamwork, it's worth putting some thought into how you can foster psychological safety.\nLet's take a flight across several pioneering organisations and let's explore five proven practices that allowed them to create a higher sense of psychological safety.\n1. P4Q - Equal speaking time during meetings\nP4Q is a Spanish manufacturer of electronic systems for things like solar trackers, windmills, and medical devices. The progressive company employs over 200 people in Spain, about 50 in New Mexico, USA, and another 30 in Shanghai, China.\nP4Q is based on the NER (Nuevo Estilo de Relaciones) philosophy, but the company is also inspired by Holacracy. This is reflected in how they organize their meetings, which utilize a fixed-step system that allows everyone to speak.\nThe facilitator of the meeting ensures that the speaking time is well distributed. Is someone speaking for too long? Well, then they intervene. If someone is very quiet, the facilitator ensures that a stage is created for them to talk comfortably by asking them questions and actively involving them in the conversation.\nThis practice fosters psychological safety by providing everyone with the same amount of speaking time to ensure everyone feels heard and has the opportunity to speak up.\n2. Haier - Mood boards\nBased in China, Haier is the world’s number one home appliance manufacturer and boasts over 70,000 employees. It’s also one of the most innovative companies in the world. Haier’s legendary former CEO and chairman, Zhang Ruimin, is perhaps the leading management strategist of modern times.\nAll across the company, you will see mood boards on the wall filled with emoticons and Chinese signs that are used to stimulate conversation and promote psychological safety among factory workers.\nBefore the start of each shift, team members are encouraged to express their mood by picking a face from one of three options: sad, satisfied, or happy. Using emojis instead of words makes it easier for some to express themselves.\nAs simple as they may sound, these mood boards help foster psychological safety by inviting members to express their feelings, promoting open communication, and creating an environment where people feel comfortable and trusted enough to share their thoughts and ideas.\n3. Buurtzorg - Annual festival\nBuurtzorg is a home healthcare organization that works with small teams of district nurses and utilizes a very progressive organizational model. Buurtzorg currently employs over 10,000 nurses and assistants in 850 self-managed teams.\nEvery year, Buurtzorg organizes Buurtzorg Festival. Now, you may think this is a disguised name for a day full of training purposes and obligations, but no—this is a real festival.\nBuurtzorg Festival is a day solely organized for the nurses to socialize, enjoy their time, and connect with each other. The festival starts with several workshops (non-work related) that are followed by an evening with various artists performing on different stages until deep into the evening.\nThe overall purpose of the festival is for people to feel like they are truly a part of the organization while creating a high sense of inclusion—all beneficial for fostering psychological safety.\n4. Viisi - No learning budget\nViisi, a Dutch mortgage advice chain founded in 2010 during the global financial crisis, is the first financial services company worldwide to implement a 100% self-organization model.\nViisi consciously works without a fixed training budget and reimburses all training costs to employees who decide to take classes. Employees determine for themselves which programs they take on.\nWith the “no learning budget” policy, Viisi creates many opportunities for people to join any training or course they want. This approach actively lowers the boundaries for people to learn, thereby contributing to psychological safety.\n5. Supercell - Celebrate failure\nSupercell, one of our Bucket List companies we still have yet to visit, is a Finnish gaming company founded in 2010. The company employs about 200 people that develop insanely popular mobile games like Hay Day, Clash of Clans, and Brawl Stars.\nThe company has a unique approach to failure: When a game has failed its development process, Supercell celebrates it. No, not the actual failure, but rather the things they’ve learned from it. In a weekly meeting, any teams that killed off their game will share the lessons learned with the rest of the organization.\nTo actually reinforce the feeling of recognizing and celebrating the learnings of their development adventure, the teams will toast to what they learned from the failure with a nice, bubbly glass of champagne.\nBy doing so, they foster psychological safety by creating an environment where it is completely safe to learn from failure.\nReady to learn more?\nFull disclosure: I borrowed (and paraphrased) most of the content of this article from our on-demand course called “'Boost Psychological Safety.” As you can probably tell by the title, this course is all about practical tools and proven practices to boost psychological safety on your team.\nSo, if you are ready to start implementing one or more of these practices, check out our Academy, where you can learn about this and a ton of other progressive methods. Oh, and you’ll also join our community of hundreds of fellow rebels as we grow and learn together.\nSound good? Learn more here.",

However, the remote hiring process can be challenging and overwhelming if not approached strategically.\nThis article aims to guide you through the steps of making the remote hiring process less painful, providing valuable insights and practical tips to optimize your recruitment efforts.\nBy leveraging technology, tapping into the right talent pools, crafting emotionally appealing job descriptions, and fostering a sense of connection and support, you can enhance the remote hiring experience for both candidates and your organization.\nTake Advantage of Technology\nRemote hiring may require recruiters to coordinate with various stakeholders, including hiring managers, interview panel members, and IT teams. Ensuring smooth communication and collaboration among dispersed team members can be demanding and time-consuming.\nIn the quest to make remote hiring a smoother and more fulfilling experience, technology becomes paramount.\nWhat you can do:\n- Incorporating HR software solutions empowers organizations to efficiently manage applications and streamline candidate communication.\n- Harnessing the vast potential of professional networking platforms like LinkedIn enables recruiters to tap into a global talent pool.\nSource Talent in the Right Places\nTo find the top remote candidates, it is essential to search in the right places. Explore online job boards and remote work-specific platforms that cater to individuals seeking remote opportunities.\nThese platforms often attract candidates with prior remote work experience, making them more likely to possess the necessary skills and adaptability required for remote roles. Additionally, networking on professional platforms and participating in industry-specific forums can help you connect with top remote talent.\nIdentify Qualities of Decent Remote Candidates\nSuccessful remote workers possess specific traits that contribute to their effectiveness and productivity in a remote setting. When evaluating candidates, look for qualities such as:\n- self-motivation\n- strong communication skills\n- adaptability\n- ability to work independently\nPrioritizing candidates with remote work experience can provide assurance that they have already acclimated to the challenges and demands of working remotely. That reduces the learning curve and enhances their potential for success in your organization.\nDraft Emotionally Appealing Job Descriptions\nTransform job descriptions into captivating narratives that stir emotions within remote candidates. By showcasing the emotional rewards of working remotely, you’ll capture candidates’ attention.\nUse descriptive and engaging language to convey your company’s values, mission, and commitment to supporting remote employees. Illuminate the joys of your remote work culture, highlighting flexible schedules, work-life balance, and opportunities for personal and professional growth. Providing a glimpse into the emotional rewards of working remotely can make your job postings stand out.\nWork Well on Pre-Interview Stage\nCommunication is the lifeline of remote hiring. Establish clear and consistent channels of communication to keep candidates informed and engaged at every stage.\nEffective communication builds trust, reduces anxiety, and demonstrates your organization’s commitment to a transparent and supportive hiring process.\nBefore the interview, provide candidates with detailed insights into your company’s remote work policies, expectations, and team dynamics. Transparency is key to helping candidates envision themselves as integral parts of your organization.\nOffer glimpses into your company culture, showcasing the warmth and camaraderie they can expect. By nurturing a sense of belonging and integration, you lay the foundation for successful employment and remote collaborations.\nEvaluate a Talent’s Adaptability for Remote Work\nRemote work demands emotional resilience and adaptability. During interviews, ask candidates situational and behavioral questions that gauge their ability to handle challenges, manage stress, and thrive in a remote work environment.\nLook for indicators of self-motivation, self-discipline, and the ability to work autonomously. By assessing a candidate’s emotional fitness for remote work, you can identify individuals who possess the necessary mindset and skills to excel in a remote role.\nEstablish an Emotional Connection During Interviews\nVirtual interviews can be impersonal, but it’s essential to establish an emotional connection with remote candidates.\nWhat you can do:\n- Show genuine interest in their experiences, aspirations, and personal growth.\n- Assess not only their qualifications but also their body language and non-verbal cues.\n- Create a warm and welcoming virtual environment, making candidates feel comfortable and valued.\nBuilding an emotional connection during interviews helps candidates envision a future with your company and enhances their overall candidate experience.\nConducting assessments and evaluating candidates remotely might limit recruiters’ ability to accurately assess certain skills or qualities. Hands-on tasks, group exercises, or presentations that are typically part of in-person interviews can be more challenging to replicate virtually, potentially impacting the overall assessment process.\nStreamline Remote Assessment\nAssessing candidates remotely can be made easier with the help of various technologies. Here are some approaches and technologies that can streamline the remote assessment process:\n- Leverage online assessment platforms\nThese platforms offer a range of coding tests, psychometric assessments, or situational judgment tests. They can also enable recruiters to evaluate candidates’ technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and cognitive aptitude remotely. - Virtual whiteboarding and coding tools\nFor technical roles, virtual whiteboarding tools can be used to assess candidates’ ability to solve problems, design solutions, or demonstrate their coding skills collaboratively. These tools provide a shared virtual space for candidates and recruiters to work together on visual tasks. - Online skill-specific tests\nDepending on the role, consider using skill-specific online tests or simulations to assess candidates remotely. - Recorded video interviews\nIn addition to live video interviews, consider using recorded video interviews. Such platforms allow candidates to record their responses to pre-set questions at their convenience. Recruiters can then review the recordings at their own pace, enabling flexibility and efficient evaluation. - AI-powered assessment tools\nExplore AI-powered assessment tools that use natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze written responses, coding samples, or video interviews. These tools can help recruiters assess candidates’ skills, personality traits, and cultural fit more objectively and efficiently. - Online reference checks\nConduct reference checks through online platforms or email to verify candidates’ qualifications and work experience. Utilize professional networking platforms like LinkedIn to gather additional information about candidates and their professional connections.\nProvide Emotional Support\nRemote hiring and work can sometimes feel isolating. It poses challenges during the onboarding and integration of new employees. Without in-person interactions, it may be more difficult to immerse new hires in the company culture, establish relationships with team members, and provide comprehensive training and support.\nAs a compassionate employer, it’s crucial to provide emotional support to remote candidates.\nWhat you can do:\n- Encourage open dialogue by creating channels for candidates to express their concerns, questions, and aspirations.\n- Offer resources for mental health and well-being, such as access to employee assistance programs or wellness initiatives.\n- Regularly check in with remote candidates to understand their emotional needs and provide the necessary support or assistance.\nDemonstrating empathy and care fosters a positive employer-employee relationship from the very beginning.\nConclusion\nRemote hiring doesn’t have to be a painful and disconnected experience. By embracing the emotional aspects of the journey, you can create a hiring process that resonates deeply with remote candidates. Leveraging empathy and emotional intelligence, you can forge genuine connections and elevate the remote hiring experience.\nAuthors\nTimothy Partasevitch\nTimothy Partasevitch leads the marketing and growth teams at Juggl.

    "content": "Defining Your Leadership Principles\nStrategies and Techniques for Change Agents, Strategists, and Innovators\nOperate by principles that are so clearly laid out that their logic can easily be assessed, and you and others can see if you walk the talk. — Ray Dalio, Principles\nAny leader, from a CEO of a large company to the manager of a small team, is trying to get more throughput, efficiency, and more done. We think we want a fast organization. But speed can take you in any direction, including the wrong one. It’s not just the speed we want; we want speed with a direction and purpose — a strategy, a goal, a specific direction. This is a vector.\nWhat sound principles can do for an organization is to define the swim lanes (guiding the direction) and act as a lubricant to the machinery of the organization ( helping increase velocity), allowing the organization to be faster toward achieving its goals. Principles, sound principles meeting Ray Dalio’s test, help both speed and direction for your strategy. They define a vector for how people work within the organization.\nPrinciples for Principles\nA principle is a proposition or value that is a guide for behavior or evaluation.1\nAmazon’s sixteen leadership principles are perhaps the best-known set of strong “swim lanes” used to create a guiding direction and act as a catalyst.\nHere are the meta-principles guiding the development of principles.\nPrinciple One — Understand what you are trying to achieve. What is the “from —>to” you are trying to achieve?\nPrinciple Two — Officers eat last. The most senior leaders must participate, digest, grok and be the most active users of the principles for change to happen. They have to use the principles and make changes in their style based on the principles.\nPrinciple Three — Simple but not simplistic. Principles must be simple to understand for someone of reasonable good judgment to know if they are hitting the spirit of the principle. But simplistic “value” based statements like “have integrity” or “be collaborative” are too open for individual and different interpretations.\nPrinciple Four — The set requires balance and coverage. You have to have enough principles to address the surface area being applied. I don’t worry about having too many. Having “too many” meaningful principles is a high-quality problem.\nIdentifying and articulating your organization’s or team’s leadership principles should be a collaborative, iterative, and strategic activity. What it should not be is rushed, delegated, or outsourced. Here’s a plan to develop your leadership principles.\nThinking in Outcomes\nStart the process by motivating your team with a vision exercise. Craft a future press release dated five years in the future, imagining your team’s future successes over. Before writing it, consider questions such as:\nHow did your organization grow in that time?\nWhat changes occurred in the culture and organizational norms?\nWhat do daily interactions (e.g., employee experiences, meetings, decision-making) look like?\nHow did you scale? Move quickly? Become agile?\nWhat were the most significant obstacles to overcome?\nWhat were the leadership principles that made these successes possible?\nRemember, your future press release doesn’t have to be perfect. Think of it as a living document, something you can return to as often as you’d like. Once it’s drafted, imagine where gaps may exist between the ideal and the real world. In other words, assess your culture with an objective and critical eye. It’s common for a culture to work significantly differently from how we say we want it to work. Now is the time for a brutal self-critique via “truth-seeking.” Name the problems. Define clear and tangible goals.\nBuild Out Your Principles\nLeadership principles are only words on a page without human beings to actively use them. Each principle is just a frame on which you hang real-world scenarios. Start building a portfolio of potential scenarios and outcomes based on your vision of the future to build out these leadership principles. Principles are foundational by definition. Here are some questions to help see this foundation from different angles and perspectives:\nWho are your customers, and what value will you bring them? What problems will you solve? Get crisp on your value proposition(s). Spot the principle driving them.\nWho are your stakeholders, and what should they expect of you? For example, if partners are central to your business, what should partners expect from you? What do you expect from partners?\nWhat are your beliefs about the future? How does this define our organization?\nDo you have a solid or central mission? How does the mission outline potential principles?\nWhat are the non-negotiables in your organization? For example, perhaps you have a “no brilliant jerks” rule that needs to be reflected in principles.\nWhat do you prize in terms of how work is done in the organization?\nHow do you hold each other accountable?\nHow does an employee know if they’re making the right decision? Or are empowered to make a decision? Or are we doing the right thing?\nWhat should the organization be famous for on employee review sites like Glassdoor?\nConsider questions like these to add dimensions to what topics need to be addressed via principles. These ideas are unshaped iron needing to be worked and reworked, tooled and retooled, and finally burnished to a shine.\nBrainstorm Candidate Principles\nNurture a free flow of concepts. Press participants to further define each principle by providing examples of what the principle looks like in practice. Ask them to lobby on behalf of the principle on why it should become “one of the few.” Write paragraph-length explanations for each principle to give it more context and dimension.\nResearch on other companies and their principles can be done here or perhaps before you start building your principles. Study, critique, or copy leadership principles and tenets from companies you admire. At this point, ideas and options are just being developed, and looking externally for benchmarks and examples helps for this purpose.\nRationalize and Consolidate the First Draft\nThis needs to be done by the decision-makers — the senior leadership accountable for the organization. These company leaders will not only be asked to get these principles “right” but also to be their primary champions. For leadership principles to drive an organization, the executives must communicate them and hold others accountable.\nOnce established, the leadership team must use the principles in a recognized, featured manner in all of their dealings together. The rest of the organization is watching closely, and true adoption must happen at the executive team level first.\nIn other words, make sure you totally understand and believe in these principles by contributing to their formation. Meet multiple times to draft them. Don’t rush. Picture yourself writing them in pencil or “etching them in Jell-O.” Keep refining them and give them the time they need to bake correctly.\netch your principles in Jell-O\nRationalize the list to the essential cultural attributes which could guide most team members to support your strategy and excel in their performance. What do you want the company to be famous for? This is why obvious principles don’t add value — they don’t differentiate your culture or strategy. Be comfortable knowing that your culture shouldn’t be right for everybody.\nAvoid Empty Calories\nThe goal of having company principles is to distinguish how your culture helps you compete and win. Real principles are difference-makers in your business, not a “feel good” exercise. They are not a poster. Don’t make them too vague or one-size-fits-all. If your principles could be used in almost any company, if they don’t create a competitive edge for you, if they are, as they say, “apple pie and motherhood,” then they are empty calories.\nOf course, “being ethical” is non-negotiable. Of course, “treat others with respect” is expected. But in both cases, do they help you compete and identify the right people for your organization? Are they difference-makers?\nIn his Harvard Business Review article, “Make Your Principles Mean Something,” Patrick Lencioni writes, “Take a look at this list of corporate values: Communication. Respect. Integrity. Excellence. They sound pretty good, don't they? Maybe they even resemble your own company's values. If so, you should be nervous. These are the corporate values of Enron, as claimed in its 2000 annual report. And they're absolutely meaningless. Indeed, most values statements,” says the author, “are bland, toothless, or just plain dishonest. And far from being harmless, as some executives assume, they're often highly destructive. Empty values statements create cynical and dispirited employees and undermine managerial credibility.”2\nLike junk food, these principles are worse than nothing. Live long enough on nothing but junk food and empty calories, and the food become part of the disease.\nBuild Mechanisms\nHow does one practice or manifest a principle? In many cases, your organization likely has ways that demonstrate the principle. Sometimes, you may need to incorporate new practices to bring the principle to life. But if you can’t identify a set of recognizable techniques for a principle, then it will be harder to train, recognize, and put into practice. Here’s an example:\nPrinciple. “We will be data-driven in our operations.”\nMechanism. Every process or service that could impact the customer experience has to have a high-bar SLA (service level agreement), which is calculated on a daily basis. If the SLA fails, the team has to complete a “correction of error” to drive root cause analysis and improvement.\nAdding mechanisms to each principle allows you to flesh it out from a mere concept to a defined approach.\nDraft Your Principles and Communicate\nIt’s time to draft your principles, announce, and communicate them. Set the expectations that you are hoping for and live with them for a while at first. Adjustments will be considered in the future. Like public policy or laws, adjustments will be diligently performed with due process, not just because someone is uncomfortable or upset. If you’ve done your hard work getting to this point, your belief and conviction behind this set for your organization should be extremely high and explainable.\nConsistent communication is the key. Every senior person needs the talk track. If one of your senior people is reluctant, pessimistic, or passive-aggressive, you have a real problem. Everyone will sense the toxicity, which may give others the impression they can opt out of the initiative. My recommendation is to fire at least one. Let the organization know why they were fired. This sets the tone that these principles are real.\nTeam Tenets Can Do the Trick\nMany teams at Amazon have a set of tenets. These are principles and goals specialized for that team in support of their mission. If your organization has principles, but you want to sharpen them up for your team, think of team tenets. Or if you’re a team leader and can’t tackle the entire enterprise, team tenets can be a way to lift your team to a higher level of performance. The process is the same; we’ve just scaled the application down a bit.\nThe Amazon human resource team has published their tenets. They have many of the same traits as Amazon’s LPs: clarity, definition, and ability to act and judge against them. However, they are tailored for the mission of this team instead of the entire organization:\nAMAZON'S HR TENETS:\nWE BUILD A WORKPLACE FOR AMAZONIANS TO INVENT ON BEHALF OF CUSTOMERS.Employees come to Amazon to do meaningful work, and we make that easier by removing barriers, fixing defects, and enabling self-service. Applying to, working at, and leaving Amazon should be frustration-free experiences.\nWe seek to be the most scientific HR organization in the world. We form hypotheses about the best talent acquisition, talent retention, and talent development techniques and then set out to prove or disprove them with experiments and careful data collection.\nAs we develop new programs and services, we work backward from the employee and candidate, understanding our work has a direct impact on customers. We prioritize work that results in measurable impact for our customers.\nWe acknowledge that no process or policy can be so well designed as to properly cover every situation. When common sense is at odds with one of our policies or practices, we make high-judgment exceptions.\nWe seek to be the most technically proficient HR organization in the world. Our team includes dedicated engineers, computer scientists, and principals who develop world-class, easy, and intuitive products for candidates and employees.\nWe manage HR as a business, and we must scale faster through technology and simplified processes rather than through HR headcount growth. We rigorously audit ourselves to disrupt and reinvent HR industry standards.\nWe favor straightforward, two-way communications. When we talk about our work, we use plain language and specific examples over generalizations and corporate-speak.3\nLast Words on Culture\nIn closing, culture is the environment in which your employees get their jobs done. Make it (your culture) be a competitive advantage for achieving your strategy and mission.\nBecause your culture is how your company makes decisions when you’re not there. It’s the set of assumptions your employees use to resolve the problems they face every day. It’s how they behave when no one is looking. If you don’t methodically set your culture, then two-thirds of it will end up being accidental, and the rest will be a mistake.\n― Ben Horowitz, What You Do Is Who You Are: How to Create Your Business Culture\nOnward!\nJohn\nAbout The Digital Leader Newsletter\nThis is a newsletter for change agents, strategists, and innovators.

    "content": "Five winning growth strategies for the year ahead\nMany of the successful things that happen in our businesses come from strategy and planning, but it’s the habits and mindset behind this work which really drive success and growth.\nThis article identifies five winning business strategies and leadership habits, which are absolutely key to unlocking strategic growth - no matter what the economic climate may bring.\n1. View everything as a business growth opportunity\nWhen we hear the news that a recession is coming or an economic downturn, we can't help but label that as something ‘bad’. However, for successful companies, the trick is to try and view everything as an opportunity.\nWhen something happens that you might previously have thought was bad news, start thinking about how you can turn this into a competitive advantage and build it into your growth plan, despite the tough economic times.\nHow to react to bad business or economic news\nWhen receiving news which could be perceived negatively, immediately take a deep breath. Ask yourself the question; How can I make this the best thing that’s ever happened to me?\nEven if there are tough decisions to make, how can I make sure that my business can endure and grow during uncertain times? That mindset of seeing everything as an opportunity to thrive will help you get through the coming year in the best possible shape.\nHow can I think about growth in tough times?\nYou should also try to stop, think and plan - try and build that into your daily routine. If you are running around and busy with the day-to-day, you simply won't have the time and space to see these strategic growth opportunities that might be right in front of you.\nThe impact of setting aside designated time to solve problems and make decisions will be felt across the business, no matter your size. It will help you focus on achieving growth and developing your growth strategy.\n2. Do less\nThe tendency we have when things are challenging is that we work harder, we run faster, and we do more. The danger with that is if we get bogged down with the day-to-day, we’re not doing the stuff that matters. Growing your business isn't always about working more - it's about working smarter. This breaks down into two parts:\n- How you can do less but still achieve growth\n- How the business can do less but still be profitable in uncertain times\nHow you can do less?\nLet's start with how you can do less. The people who are most effective at growing their business, are the ones who reduce the number of decisions that they need to individually make.\nAs you grow and build your team and capability, you should be reducing the number of decisions you have to make and pass them down to other people. It's really easy to hold on to some of the stuff that you used to do, but for you to be the most effective, you need to be doing only the things that only you can do.\nAsk yourself, do you need to get involved in this or, is there someone else able to do it? Do I even need to see this? Once you see something, it's very hard to unsee it and you start pulling on a thread.\nBefore you know it, you’re involved in stuff that you really don't need to be - and suddenly you've wasted that time. It's prevented you from doing the things that matter. Reduce what comes across your desk, so that they can move out the door and just happen.\nThe other thing to question is, when you're getting involved in things, are you making a significant difference? If you turned your hand to almost anything in your business, right now, you could make it better, right? But that doesn't mean you should turn your hand to everything. The whole point of building a team is that you can leave them to get on with it and do a great job.\nIf there's no one with the right skill set to help you, then this is an opportunity for you to build capability within your team.\nTrain someone up to do this task, so that you don't need to be doing it over time. It's essential to take the long view. Yes, it’ll solve the problem right now if you just do it, but if you don't want to be doing it over and over again, you need to put the extra effort in to build that capability to train that person or hire in new skills.\nNo one wins when you are bogged down doing the day-to-day. We know that one of the biggest challenges facing business owners right now, is working in the business instead of working on the business.\nHow can the business do less?\nThere are also two key areas where the business can do less:\n- Say goodbye to your least profitable clients. If you’re holding on to unprofitable clients and losing money on them, what's the point? Free up your team to focus on the ones that can generate the most profit.\n- Stop offering certain unprofitable products and services, and focus on where you can make the most difference to your clients.\n- By developing a focused skillset you can streamline your business, giving you more time for the work that has the best margins.\n3. Measure more\nMeasure more often, in more detail, and with more diligence than you've ever done before.\nNow is the time to have your finger on the pulse. As we go through a period of economic uncertainty, you don’t want to be flying blind. This is not the time to be winging it.\nWhat do I need to measure in my business?\nYou need to understand the numbers in your business, understand what matters, and be able to have the intelligence so you can make swift decisions well. This is critical to your success for the year ahead. Ask yourself these questions:\n- Can you measure profit by project? If you're a service-based business, and you look at your project profitability, are you able to project by project, show whether you're making money or not in real-time, and see whether you're on track so you can correct it if not?\n- Can you measure your profitability by customer? Do you know which are your most profitable and least profitable customers? Can you produce a league table?\n- Can you measure your profitability by product, or by service? Do you know exactly how much margin you make on each department or product line? And do you have that information at your fingertips?\nWhat retrospective and predictive measures should I look at?\nYou should be looking at the following retrospective measures and predictive measures in your business:\n- Retrospective measures include your management accounts and money in the bank. They tell you your profit and loss, all of the sales that you've done, the invoices you’ve issued and the cash that you've collected for that particular month, or that particular year - it's a history lesson, it tells you what has happened.\n- Predictive measures are metrics that will tell you what your performance will be like in the future. If you have a good month now, that's not because of things that you're doing now, it's because of all the things that you've done previously. It's the predictive measures that are going to be the key determinant of your success.\nWhat are the key metrics for future growth and success?\nThink about what metrics are key to your future success. Looking at early sales indicators for example, it might be the number of people added to your email newsletter, social media engagements or people downloading a particular piece of content.\nIt might be a number of commerce, such as networking events you've attended, conversations you've had or booked sales calls.\nThose metrics are all the things which happen before a sale, yet they're indicators of what those future sales are going to be in terms of conversion rates and average client value.\nBuilding metrics for sales growth\nWhen you put all of these metrics together they build a picture of what your sales are going to be over the coming months. If you can work out the ones that are key to your success, you will have a glimpse into the future that your competitors don't have.\nThat glimpse into the future will allow you to see opportunities coming and make sure you have adequate resources in place. Making those decisions before you need to make them is really important and gives you time to do it in a controlled, methodical, and thoughtful way.\n4. Spend more time on sales and marketing\nWhen a recession or an economic downturn is coming you’ll read a lot of advice telling you to conserve cash and focus on retaining your customers and looking after existing customers.\nThese are defence tactics, which do have their place but there’s a lot to be said for going hard on the offensive - for pursuing a real growth strategy. Especially if others are standing still.\nA great way to sell through whatever comes next is to pick up so much work that you don't even notice that there's a recession. The key to that is to spend more time on your sales strategy and your marketing strategy.\nThe number one challenge right now for every type of business is winning new business, opening up new markets and new customers and potentially winning new market share. In difficult economic conditions, businesses often say “it's hard to get prospects' attention”, “there are not enough leads coming through”, “budgets are too small and decisions keep getting delayed”.\nHowever, when this is the case, it means we're not spending enough time on new business and on market development. If we can spend more time on this, we're going to find more opportunities and more leads, and we're going to get more prospects' attention. Eventually we're going to increase our cashflow and our profitability.\nThe keys to unlocking strategic growth\n- Hire some sales and marketing resource. If you want to spend more time on it but don’t have the capacity, you can outsource the problem. If you’re not in the position to hire someone full-time, or even part-time, there are a ton of brilliant sales and marketing, freelancers and agencies that you can bring in to help with this.\n- Develop a sales culture to get your whole team involved, so the workload is shared and owned by everyone. You might night not need a sales team - you just need everyone to have a business development mindset.\n- Remember that doing nothing is not an option. If you do nothing your growth strategy will fail.\nHabits to help momentum\nOne of the key areas for growth is right under your nose. Get really good at generating revenue from existing clients. These habits will build momentum, create energy, and make a massive difference:\n- Grade your clients. Work out how much revenue you're generating from your top 10 clients and make individual growth plans for them. Make sure that you're spending proportionate time with the ones that are most likely to generate future revenue.\n- Implement a referral scheme across the whole business that generates opportunities, and generates referrals from your existing clients.\n- Pitch to your existing clients to let them know all the services that you offer, especially if these have expanded since you first started working together.\n- Write down your list of your top 10 dream clients you'd love to work within 2023.\n- Set weekly bite-sized sales goals, and stick to them.\n- This shouldn't be a lonely pursuit for you as the business owner, this should be something your whole team can be involved in.\nHelp them to understand the power of generating revenue, and why it matters, talk about targets, and communicate progress regularly. Get them involved in this process.\n5. Build alignment\nGreat things happen when we can get everyone pulling together in the same direction. This has to start from the top.\nMaking sure that you and your business partner or senior leadership team, are all on the same page takes time., But the clearer you can be, the more focused you can be.\nThe greater alignment you have at the top, the greater the impact on the whole business.\nWhat's going to make the biggest difference to your business?\nIf you don't know where you need to focus to make the biggest difference, you, your leadership team and the whole business will end up doing stuff, but you're not going to achieve something spectacular.\nFocus on something that is inspiring, that makes a big difference and that you can all get behind.\nMake sure that you align individual objectives to company goals, so everyone in your business knows what their number one objective is each week, month and year, and how that contributes to the number one objective for the business.\nCommunication is key\nWhen lots of businesses moved online during the pandemic, many also moved from monthly team meetings to weekly team meetings.\nThat gave them four times as many opportunities to build in that alignment throughout the year, to communicate what was important and to refocus on the stuff that's going to make the biggest difference.\nKeeping up this opportunity for conversation and collaboration is vital to ensure you’re all on the same page.\nNobody really knows what the next 12 months have in store for any of us, but by building these habits into your every day, you'll have a cracking year.",

    "content": "The 20 Mile March is a concept developed in the book Great by Choice. Enterprises that prevail in turbulence self-impose a rigorous performance mark to hit with great consistencyâlike hiking across the United States by marching at least 20 miles a day, every day. The march imposes order amidst disorder, discipline amidst chaos, and consistency amidst uncertainty. The 20 Mile March works only if you actually hit your march year after year; if you set a 20 Mile March and then fail to achieve it, you may well get crushed byÂ events.\nMedia and Articles\nExcerpts from Great by Choice\nImagine youâre standing with your feet in the Pacific Ocean in San Diego, California, looking inland. Youâre about to embark on a three-thousand-mile walk, from San Diego to the tip of Maine. On the first day, you march 20 miles, making it out of town. On the second day, you march 20 miles. And again, on the third day, you march 20 miles, heading into the heat of the desert. Itâs hot, more than a hundred degrees, and you want to rest in the cool of your tent. But you donât. You get up and you march 20 miles. You keep the pace, 20 miles a day.\nThen the weather cools, and youâre in comfortable conditions with the wind at your back, and you could go much farther. But you hold back, modulating your effort. You stick with your 20 miles. Then you reach the Colorado high mountains and get hit by snow, wind, and temperatures below zeroâand all you want to do is stay in your tent. But you get up. You get dressed. You march your 20 miles. You keep up the effortâ20 miles, 20 miles, 20 milesâthen you cross into the plains, and itâs glorious springtime, and you can go 40 or 50 miles in a day. But you donât. You sustain your pace, marching 20 miles. And eventually, you get to Maine.\nNow, imagine another person who starts out with you on the same day in San Diego. He gets all excited by the journey and logs 40 miles the first day. Exhausted from his first gigantic day, he wakes up to hundred-degree temperatures. He decides to hang out until the weather cools, thinking, âIâll make it up when conditions improve.â He maintains this patternâbig days with good conditions, whining and waiting in his tent on bad daysâas he moves across the western United States. Just before the Colorado high mountains, he gets a spate of great weather and he goes all out, logging 40-to 50-mile days to make up lost ground. But then he hits a huge winter storm when utterly exhausted. It nearly kills him and he hunkers down in his tent, waiting for spring. When spring finally comes, he emerges, weakened, and stumbles off toward Maine. By the time he enters Kansas City, you, with your relentless 20 mile march, have already reached the tip of Maine. You win, by a huge margin.\nSome people believe that a world characterized by radical change and disruptive forces no longer favors those who engage in consistent 20 Mile Marching. Yet the great irony is that when we examined just this type of out-of-control, fast-paced environment, we found that every 10X company exemplified the 20 Mile March principle during the era we studied.\nNow, you might be wondering, âBut wait a minute! Youâre confusing things here. Perhaps 10X companies could afford to behave this way because they were so successful and dominant. Perhaps 20 Mile Marching is a result of success, a luxury of success, not a driver of success.â But the evidence shows the 10X companies embraced a 20 Mile March early, long before they were big companies. Furthermore, every comparison company failed to 20 Mile March with anything close to the consistency shown by the 10X cases. In fact, this is one of the strongest contrasts in our study.\nHaving a clear 20 Mile March focuses the mind; because everyone on the team knows the markers and their importance, they can stay on track. Financial markets are out of your control. Customers are out of your control. Earthquakes are out of your control. Global competition is out of your control. Technological change is out of your control. Most everything is ultimately out of your control. But when you 20 Mile March, you have a tangible point of focus that keeps you and your team moving forward, despite confusion, uncertainty, and even chaos.",

    "domain": "rhythmsystems.com",
    "age": "1,117 days ago",
    "content": "Are you feeling overwhelmed by how your team is measuring success? Are you looking for an easy-to-understand way to set targets and understand progress?\nDon't worry - Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) are here to save the day. OKRs are a process used by many leading companies to measure progress across departments and divisions, track the big picture, and help teams stay aligned with their overall objectives.\nI will provide an expert guide on writing and applying OKRs in your business in this article. I will also share examples from top business leaders who have successfully implemented them in their organizations.\nAlign your goals with your company's goals\nAligning your goals with your company's goals is an essential part of successful OKR writing. When writing objectives and key results, you should ensure they align with the company's mission and values. This helps you stay on target, connects each team's OKRs to the grand vision of the organization, and empowers employee engagement.\nCreating cross-departmental OKRs further highlights this importance. By collaborating on these OKRs, teams can move forward as a single unit toward achieving their shared objectives and key results. This also allows departments to see how their goals align with each other, which can be very valuable when tackling bigger projects to avoid duplicate work and catch problems before they become too large.\nCreate a Clear Objective For Your OKR\nHaving a single goal that captures everyone's attention allows focus on achieving success in one direction instead of having multiple dispersed goals requiring different approaches or strategies. It prevents re-work due to lack of communication among teams and makes maximum goal attainment achievable with fewer resources. Therefore, creating a clear objective is essential for organizations seeking maximum goal attainment and business results.\nTo effectively communicate across departments, it's essential to ensure that everyone understands the interdependencies between their efforts and those of other departments or teams. This understanding can only be achieved if the objective is crystal clear.\nDefine Measurable Key Results\nIf you want to write successful OKRs, a key step is defining measurable key results. These key results can quantify progress toward achieving your OKR goals in a tangible way. This means you must ensure that they are numerically measurable, using numeric targets, dated milestones, or other concrete metrics. The OKR framework is flexible enough for you to write key results in a way that makes sense to your organization.\nFor example, if you have an OKR goal of launching a new product this year, a measurable key result could be gaining 100,000 active monthly users by the end of the year.\nWhatever you set out to do with your OKRs, clearly outlined and measurable key results will help you track your progress and make sure that everyone involved understands what needs to be done for the bigger-picture goal to be achieved.\nPlan Your Key Initiatives and Rocks\nWhen writing OKRs, one of the most important processes is planning your key initiatives and Quarterly Rocks. Before you start prioritizing tasks for yourself and your team, it's best to consider what those tasks will encompass and what key things need to get done. You'll need to establish a timeline with action items and assign people responsible for executing them.\nIn addition, it's crucial that you create well-defined objectives that are measurable and achievable in the given timeframe. This could include tasks such as increasing customer satisfaction or upscaling a product’s sales performance by 10%. Ensure each Rock is tangible by setting concrete goals to which everyone can refer back when assessing progress against the objectives.\nOnce all of your goals have been identified and outlined, plot a timeline that outlines the issues and prioritizes each according to importance. This should detail who is doing what, when they must be completed by, and who has primary responsibility for their successful completion. A clear plan will help ensure realistic expectations and success can easily be measured!\nEnsure Transparency and Cross-Department Collaboration\nEnsuring transparency across the organization is critical when it comes to writing OKRs. All employees must be on the same page, from executive team members and team leaders to front-line employees. Every individual needs to understand how their job contributes towards achieving the overall organizational goal and how their success is measured; see our OKRs for business development examples.\nTo accomplish this, communication and collaboration are essential. Regular meetings, discussions, and progress reviews should be held throughout the process to ensure everyone's efforts move harmoniously. Leaders should also regularly provide feedback so that everyone feels they have ownership of their work and can make meaningful contributions. By having an open dialogue, teams will become more productive and more engaged in their organizational role. Ultimately, this will result in better results for the entire organization.\nThe Rhythm of Work is a strategic framework that helps organizations create an effective and efficient workflow. It involves setting up regular meetings, discussions, and progress reviews to ensure everyone is on the same page, from executive team members to front-line employees. Additionally, it's important to choose the right software and people tools to help facilitate communication and collaboration across the organization. Finally, it's essential to avoid common mistakes.\nOKR Pitfalls to Avoid\nNot setting measurable objectives: Make sure each Rock is tangible by setting concrete goals that everyone can refer back to when assessing progress against the objectives.\nNot having a clear timeline: Plot out a timeline that outlines the issues and prioritize each one according to importance. This should detail who is doing what, when they must be completed by, and who has primary responsibility for their successful completion.\nNot ensuring transparency across the organization: Ensure all employees are on the same page, from executive team members and team leaders to front-line employees. Regular meetings, discussions, and progress reviews should be held throughout the process to ensure everyone's efforts are moving harmoniously.\nNot using the right software and people tools: Choose the right software and people tools to help facilitate communication and collaboration across the organization.\nNot providing regular feedback: Leaders should also provide feedback regularly so that everyone feels like they have ownership of their work and can make meaningful contributions.\nOKRs, when implemented correctly, work.

    "content": "Good leadership? It all starts with trust.\nTrust is one of the most vital forms of capital a leader has today. Amid economic turbulence and global uncertainty, people are increasingly turning to their employers and business leaders as a source of truth, rather than their institutions and government officials, according to a new global survey by Harvard Business School’s Institute for the Study of Business in Global Society and the Edelman Trust Institute.1\nTrust, which can be defined as a belief in the abilities, integrity, and character of another person, is often thought of as something that personal relationships are built on, but according to recent research in Harvard Business Review, trust is the foundation of most successful organizations.2\nThe benefits of a high-trust organization\nA high-trust organization is one in which employees feel safe to take risks, express themselves freely, and innovate. When trust is instilled in an organization, tasks get accomplished with less difficulty because people are more likely to collaborate and communicate with each other in productive ways. As a result, outcomes tend to be more successful.\nIn fact, according to a study in Harvard Business Review, people at high-trust companies report 74% less stress, 106% more energy at work, 50% higher productivity, 13% fewer sick days, 76% more engagement, 29% more satisfaction with their lives, and 40% less burnout than people at low-trust companies.3\nIn contrast, employees at low-trust organizations are often bogged down by office politics and infighting. They are more likely to withhold information and hoard resources because they don’t feel safe sharing them. As a result, decision making is slower and less effective.\nAt a time when distrust seems to be the default, fostering a high-trust organization has never been so important—and it often starts with leadership.\nHow leaders build trust\nLeaders play a crucial role in building trust within their organizations. Leaders set the tone for the culture and establish norms of behavior. If leaders aren’t focused on trust, communication, collaboration, and innovation will suffer.\nSo how can leaders build trust? It starts with creating a safe environment where people feel comfortable expressing themselves and taking risks. It means being transparent and authentic. And it requires establishing clear expectations and following through on commitments.\nHere are some things leaders can do to foster an environment of trust:\nBe transparent\n- Share information openly and candidly. Keep the team updated on what’s going on in the company and at the senior leadership level. Don’t withhold resources from employees or make decisions in secret.\n- Provide regular feedback. Be clear about the team vision and expectations of team members. Share how employees are tracking toward their performance—both positively and constructively.\n- Encourage open communication. Create an environment where employees feel comfortable speaking up and voicing their opinions—even if those opinions differ from leadership. Leaders can follow formal processes, such as anonymous surveys, as well as informal processes, such as asking employees for their thoughts on a workplace topic at regular check-in meetings.\nBe authentic\n- Start with self-awareness. Leaders become more authentic when they begin with knowing who they are—what they value, what they’re good at, how emotionally intelligent they are—and how others perceive them.\n- Show vulnerability. When leaders reveal their trip-ups and failures, they are seen as more approachable and less arrogant4, but showing vulnerability isn’t always easy. Start by sharing lessons from past mistakes or areas of development.\n- Embrace the journey. The path to authenticity can be tricky. Nevertheless, the answer is not in pushing away difficult emotions or situations that might arise, but in embracing the ups and downs. And, above all, learning from them and sharing those learnings with team members.\nBe reliable\n- Follow through on commitments. To be reliable, leaders must ensure their actions line up with their words. Employees will quickly lose faith in a leader if they can’t rely on the leader to do as they say.\n- Establish expertise. Employees don’t expect their leaders to know everything, but they do need to hold a certain level of confidence in their leaders’ capabilities. To build their confidence, root ideas in sound evidence, suggest industry best practices, and share trends, insights, and resources relevant to the team’s function.\n- Demonstrate integrity and fairness. All team members should be able to rely on their leaders for fair treatment, especially when it comes to growth opportunities. Provide all team members with learning experiences so they can develop their skillsets, whether through projects, training programs, or other roles in the organization.\nTrain leaders to build trust\nAs an organization grows, it’s important to continue investing in leadership development. That way, the next generation of leaders will understand how to build trust within their teams—and why it’s so important. This means giving them the skills and tools they need, such as authentic leadership training, communication training, and DEI training, to name a few. It also means ensuring that leaders meet regularly with team members to foster open dialogue and build connections.\nUltimately, leaders set the tone for trust within an organization. By investing in leadership training and development, organizations can ensure that this crucial element of success is always front and center, resulting in increased employee engagement, better team performance, and higher levels of productivity.\n- Van Voorhis, Scott, “People Trust Business, But Expect CEOs to Drive Social Change,” Harvard Business School Working Knowledge, October 21, 2022. https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/people-trust-business-but-expect-ceos-to-drive-social-change. ↩︎\n- Frances X.

    "content": "Predictable Revenue’s Updated Sales Development Methodology\nToday I’d like to share a little about our content plans for 2023. You probably know about us because of the Predictable Revenue book, but it’s been over 10 years since it was published, and to no surprise, some of the tactics need updating. While email-specific tactics have evolved, the core ideas around specializing sales roles are still relevant today.\nWe’ve always been working on updating our Methodology, and while our team has done a tremendous job pushing the methodology forward internally, we haven’t done a great job sharing those advancements with you.\nLast year after we published the first part of the methodology, we switched our focus to creating SEO content. And full disclosure, I have nothing against SEO; in fact, I know well enough how helpful it can be in pushing organic reach to reach a wider audience, but our approach, in this case, might not have been the best one. We produced a lot of content specific for finding long-tail clicks and building content for keyword ranking, which didn’t really contribute to pushing the methodology forward.\nAnd so, as of 2023, we’re no longer spending energy on creating that type of content. Our focus this year is on aligning our delivery teams, the people hiring, coaching, and running SDR teams, and our marketing folks and bringing them together so that they all contribute to the same goals.\nWhat this means for our content moving forward is that we’re going to publicly share our internal docs with you on how to build an SDR team, how to train sales reps, how to manage them, etc. This guide will be available on our site in a special spot where it’s easy to root around, click, download, and copy/paste as needed.\nWe’re doing this because our goal is to help create more SDRs and ensure they’re set up for success. And the one thing that we know doesn’t get a ton of attention on most teams is SDR onboarding. We’ve been guilty of it ourselves.\nSo the first chunk of content we’re working on in Q1 is SDR Onboarding, which will provide a field guide to the first 90 days as an SDR. Our hope is that it will help SDRs ramp faster and that managers will incorporate it into their onboarding.\nHere’s what we’ll cover.\nThe guide’s first section begins with the theory of SDRs, including why they exist, how they fit into an organization, and guiding principles for success in the role. We’ll also cover channel theory (i.e., how to find where your prospects hang out), mindset habits of effective SDRs, and what to expect from your first SDRs regarding activity and quota.\nFrom there, we’ll break down the specific skills an SDR needs to succeed, including plenty of tactical how-to’s on everything from cold calling, customer research, email personalization, and more.\nWe’ll discuss designing an effective sequence, getting to know your buyer personas, and handling objections. The idea is that this guide can be used by both new SDRs or managers who are looking to build their onboarding program.\nWe firmly believe that there is no right or wrong approach to outbound sales development – there’s only what works for your organization. And the only way to determine that is to run tests.\nThis guide will share what’s worked for us, helpful external resources, and research-backed insights to help you understand which tactics might work for you. This document will be your starting place for effective SDR onboarding.\nTake a look at the preview of the Table of Contents below. All we ask is that if you see something missing here or have an alternative suggestion, you let us know!\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTheory\n- Why do SDRs exist?\n- What do SDRs do?\n- SDR Mindset\n- 7 Habits of Highly Successful SDRs\n- Channel theory – finding the unusual places your prospects hang out\nSkills development\nExpectations\n- Activity, outputs, and timeframes\n- Quotas\n- Advancing in the role\nKnow your customer (MarketFit training)\n- TAM/SAM/SOM\n- ICP\n- Persona\n- Pain + Value = Meeting\nSkills to develop\n- How to identify a good account\n- How to identify a good prospect\n- Identifying buying triggers\n- Sequence design\n- How to write a cold email\n- How to personalize emails\n- How to cold call (openers, scripts, and asking for the meeting)\n- How to handle objections\n- How to book a meeting over email\n- What to do once you’ve booked a meeting\n- How to prospect on LinkedIn\n- How to follow up\n- Mining for gold in your CRM\nLearning your tools\n- Data\n- Sending email\n- Making phone calls\n- Email writing tools\n- Call recording tools\nWe’ll also share weekly updates on the methodology in our newsletter – click here to follow along.",

    "content": "So you’ve got your startup to a place where you can really kickstart growth, and have just secured Series A funding. You have your eyes set on scaling headcount, your customer base and maybe entering new markets or launching new products. But that’s easier said than done.\nThere’s inherent risks associated with scaling — namely readiness, and long-term market and consumer appetite for your product. Get it wrong and your startup could buckle under big changes.\nSo, how do you know if your business is really ready to scale, and what are the pitfalls to be wary of? Sifted turned to VCs and startup founders who’ve been through the process to find out.\nWhen should a startup think about scaling?\nAfter raising the big bucks, it can be tempting to launch into an ambitious growth plan — but not all startups will be ready, says Sanjot Malhi, partner at Northzone. The best time to scale, he says, is “when you have a clear product-market fit, a viable business model and a repeatable, scalable go-to-market motion”.\nThere’s no catch-all answer for when this moment might come. The timeline will differ across sectors, as the barriers to reaching product-market fit (PMF) vary: a consumer app can use its user feedback to make quick changes on a rolling basis, for example, whereas a techbio startup might rely on regulatory approval and a series of lengthy lab tests to reach PMF.\nPatience might not be an option for some startups, says Dr Fabian Heilemann, founder and CEO of climate VC AENU, as they’ll have to navigate a “winner-takes-all” logic in their sector where the biggest competitor in the field gains a sizeable advantage when it comes to attention from investors. Being the first to expand successfully in spaces like grocery or food delivery or micromobility, he says, brings a “huge premium”, so getting ahead and scaling quickly can be a rewarding tactic for companies in those industries.\nSteps towards scaling successfully\nSince raising a $40m Series B in January 2019, HR unicorn Personio grew its headcount from 152 to more than 1,600 by the end of 2022, according to Dealroom. It also raised close to $800m in total, including a $270m Series E in October 2021 and $200m in additional Series E funding just eight months later.\nPersonio’s chief of staff, Philipp Richter, says the company has a three-part interview process to ensure that “the team that we are building is the right one for the company”.\nThat involves:\n- A HR chat to assess work experience and communication skills;\n- An in-depth second stage with a team lead to ascertain “role-specific functional skills and expertise”, often with a task;\n- A final department interview that “looks much more closely at culture and values” to make sure a candidate will fit in with the team.\nScaling successfully is about more than hiring though. According to Richter, you need to strike a balance between headcount growth and investment in your product and other strategic decisions. That could be via acquisitions — Personio acquired employee experience automation Back, in May 2022 — or legal changes, as the startup recently went from a GmbH (a German limited liability company) to a European public limited company, making trading across EU member states easier.\nAs a growth investor, Mahli says that a key lesson is also to “never compromise on proper fundamental value drivers of the business, while retaining healthy levels of growth”. You shouldn’t sacrifice key elements of your business that customers will miss to maximise growth — reducing your scaling aspirations to protect that is the “right side of the balancing act” to stay on, Mahli says.\nWhat can go wrong?\nScaling quickly can lead to later layoffs and cost-cutting as founders try to claw back cash. When Irish unicorn Wayflyer had to lay 40% of its staff off, for example, its founders told Sifted at the time that rapid scaling was the culprit: “We tried to do too much, too soon.” British fintech Uncapped also cut staff in May, affecting 26% of jobs — when reflecting on the lessons learnt from layoffs with Sifted, its CEO Piotr Pisarz said they found that “when you grow very fast, the productivity of people decreases”, and the cuts offered a chance to “bring this back up to scratch”.\nOften, Heilemann says, one of the biggest risks of scaling quickly is doing it prematurely. When a company gets ahead of itself and throws money at an idea that hasn’t proven PMF or profitability at scale, it “basically converts cash-burn into the scaling of loss-making revenues and often only realises when it's too late”.\nIn some cases, Mahli says, startups focus too much on “vanity metrics” when it comes to scaling, prioritising public things like user growth and valuation and neglecting foundational things like “a genuinely differentiated product value proposition, or unit economics”. The risk here is that scaling valuation or users without a strong base can leave a startup overwhelmed and unable to meet a boost in demand — a slippery slope to failure.\nFor CEO of gamified workplace training platform UJJI Ludmila Milla, another risk of expanding headcount quickly is failing to maintain morale and strength in the office: it’s “not only difficult to keep that company culture alive, but also to get employees collectively and individually in line with the business's mission and vision for the future.”\nShe also highlights that staff training is one of the first focuses to fall when scaling — but companies may underestimate its importance. Her cofounder, Rafael Guper, says that when startups scale quickly, often they’ll be “hiring just as fast to keep up with their expansion plans but then struggling to keep employees in their A game for the long term”.\nLetting training fall by the wayside can impact the efficiency of a workplace and make existing employees feel neglected — the cost of recruiting an experienced team member outweighs the cost of keeping up learning and development provisions. “Not every problem that stems from rapid growth can be solved by hiring,” says Richter.\nHow to avoid those pitfalls\nEnsuring that teams aren’t motivated purely by metrics that will look good on social media is a big obstacle to avoid. Malhi says that “pure top-line or user growth, fuelled by outsized marketing budgets” can make startups grow in “unsustainable ways”. Instead focus on cementing product-market fit and viable scalability first.\nYou also need to prioritise learning and development. Though Guper notes that startups in a period of fast-paced growth often “don't have the time, knowledge and budgets to set up a learning and development plan for their teams”, you could outsource. There are also plenty of options for developing employees without breaking the bank, if you’re concerned about spending priorities.\nPersonio’s Richter says that people are the make-or-break of scaling success: “Startups wanting to scale significantly must focus on their talent.” Identifying the “crucial roles” that will “help drive impact for your business” is a key to avoiding hiring for roles that the business won’t need, and will later have to cut.\nBacktracking with layoffs or service cuts as a result of scaling too quickly can damage the reputation of a business — or can be seen as an indication that the senior team is struggling. A “strong employer brand is fundamental to business success,” Richter says, “and evolving and strengthening this must be kept in mind when significantly scaling your business.”",

    "content": "A successful sales culture provides a strategic advantage that is often underestimated. A successful sales culture produces better results over time. To have a successful sales culture, a sales organization needs to do more than ensure things aren’t toxic. Sales leaders can cultivate a positive sales culture examples by ensuring the following 11 elements are in place.\n- Strong leadership\n- Vision\n- Communication\n- High trust\n- Accountability\n- High standards\n- Nonpunitive environment\n- Development\n- Collaboration\n- Recognition\n- Integrity\nWhile some sales teams have a few of these elements, highly successful inside sales cultures have a large number of them. You know whether a sales culture is toxic culture or successful soon after observing the sales team culture. When more of these elements are present, a sales culture examples can offer a greater strategic advantage.\nStrong Leadership\nA successful sales culture doesn't create itself. The leader creates it. The leader will be highly engaged, spending a great deal of time leading their sales force. In many cases, the sales leader will work to protect their successful sales team from internal and external actors that would harm their team's results or harm the team's culture.\nVision\nThe leader of a successful sales culture sets a vision or a goal for their team to pursue. This vision or goal provides meaning and purpose, making the work something more valuable than tasks to grind out because the leader said so. The leader provides an identity to their team, making the individual contribution of each salesperson part of a larger whole. This creates a sense of belonging to something greater than self.\nCommunication\nThis element is often missing inside sales cultures. Without relentless communication, there is little chance of creating and maintaining a successful sales culture. The leader will continuously communicate with their sales force, repeating themselves until everyone believes what they say is true. The sales force also communicates with each other and their leader because it is safe to discuss problems, challenges, or obstacles to success, something missing in a toxic culture.\nHigh Trust\nIn any successful culture, sales or otherwise, you will find high levels of trust. The leader trusts their team, and their team trusts their leader. Both the leader and their team trust each other because the leadership, vision, and communication establish what is necessary and why it's important. You will not find a shred of trust in a toxic sales culture.\nAccountability\nA successful sales culture needs accountability. In sales, individuals have the autonomy to decide what to do and when to do it. Without the discipline that comes from accountability, there can be no successful culture. When everyone knows what is expected of them and when it needs to be done, the high trust and communication provide guardrails that ensure the individuals that make up the sales team meet their goals and targets.\nHigh Standards\nAny highly successful sales team will have high standards. Everyone expects the sales force to do the right work, at the right time, in the right way—and salespeople hold themselves to these high standards as well. High standards cause everyone on the sales team to do the work in the most effective way, including the approach they use to create value for their clients and prospective clients. Whenever you see low standards and negligence, you can be certain inside sales culture isn't likely to be successful.\nNonpunitive Environment\nSelling isn't easy. In fact, it's becoming more difficult. When a salesperson is struggling to produce a certain outcome or missing their targets, a nonpunitive environment will support them, helping them to improve instead of punishing them. One of the reasons salespeople grow in a successful sales culture is because they are safe to ask for the help they need to improve their results.\nDevelopment\nThe best cultures always seem to have a focus on development. The people who exist in this type of company are continually growing, developing, and improving. By focusing on continuous development, the sales team continues to improve their sales effectiveness, helping them to win at higher rates than their peer groups. A culture that develops their people doesn't happen by accident. Where it exists, you find effective salespeople. Where development is missing, the sales force repeats their mediocre result year after year.\nCollaboration\nThe sales force that works together to solve challenges has an advantage over one where each salesperson faces their challenges alone. The collaborative nature of a successful sales culture provides salespeople with the conversations that help them improve their strategies and their results. There is a large variability in sales forces. The collaborative nature of the team's culture makes it easy to have people with greater skills or experience to pass down what they know to their peers.\nRecognition\nThe sales leader who understands human beings will place a high priority on recognition. Recognition costs nothing and proves the sales leader is grateful for the salesperson's contribution. The culture where salespeople are recognized for their good work tends to be positive. The leader building a successful sales culture will find that recognition is valued by their team.\nIntegrity\nThere can be no successful sales culture without integrity. Any successful culture is built on honesty, integrity, and candor. Nothing is ever hidden, and no one is permitted to do anything that would ruin the trust among the sales team culture.\nBuilding a Successful Sales Culture\nIt isn't easy to build a successful sales culture and, once established, it requires effort to maintain over time, protecting it from anything and anyone who could disrupt it.\nA successful sales culture is one that provides the sales force with what they need to produce the results they are pursuing. The better the environment, the better the results. You can't build this kind of sales culture alone. You need each person on your team to contribute, rejecting anything that might harm the culture, the sales force, or their results. Another thing you will notice about a highly successful sales culture is that people spend a lot of time talking about selling.",

    "content": "OKRs are an essential part of any successful organization. They help align everyone around common goals and objectives. But what exactly are OKRs? And why do we need them? Let’s look at how OKRs work and why they’re such an effective tool for creating a high-performing team, but many don’t know how to properly write objectives and key results to effectively align teams to your 3-5 year strategic plan.\nWhat are OKRs?\nObjectives and Key Results (OKRs) are short-term goals and long-term outcomes that define success for every employee within your organization. These specific targets are broken down into smaller tasks, called objectives, and each objective is assigned a key person responsible for completing it. Every quarter, teams meet together to review progress against their OKRs. This helps ensure everyone understands where the company is headed and how they fit into achieving those goals.\nIn addition to helping individuals understand their roles and responsibilities, OKRs provide a framework for measuring performance. When you know what you want to accomplish, you can measure whether you’ve achieved it. For example, say you set an OKR for increasing sales revenue by 10% over the next 12 months. You could track monthly sales figures and compare them to the target number. If you see that you’re falling behind, you can adjust your plan accordingly. You want to make sure that you have some SuperGreen stretch goals to encourage your most productive employees when you write key results.\nWriting great OKRs isn’t just about tracking numbers and metrics. They’re about building a strong sense of shared purpose. Employees who believe in the mission and vision of their company will perform better because they’ll be motivated to achieve their individual objectives. In fact, research suggests that companies with high levels of employee commitment outperform competitors by up to 40%.\nCascading OKRs Across Departments\nCascading OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) is a strategy that involves aligning the goals of different teams and individuals in an organization with the company's overall strategic objectives. This approach ensures that everyone in the organization is working towards the same goals and that each team's objectives contribute to the success of the company's overall mission.\nTo effectively cascade OKRs across an organization, it is essential to start at the top. The leadership team should set clear and measurable objectives for the company as a whole, which can then be broken down into smaller objectives for each department or team. These departmental objectives should align with the company's overall objectives and contribute to achieving them.\nOnce departmental objectives have been established, they can be broken down further into individual objectives for each team member. These objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, and aligned with the departmental objectives. By cascading objectives in this way, each individual in the organization can see how their work contributes to the company's success as a whole and can work towards achieving their objectives in a way that supports the objectives of their team and the company.\nWhat is the OKR Goal Setting Framework?\nOKRs are a tool to help you achieve ambitious goals set by John Doerr when he brought OKRs to Google when working with Andy Grove. They're based on the idea that knowing what you want helps you achieve it. And they're a great way to align everyone around a common vision. So how do you set up Team OKRs in a way that aligns your team with the bigger picture? Let's look at how to write a good OKR that aligns with the company level.\nFirst, define your objective. What do you want to accomplish? Is it revenue growth? Customer acquisition? Employee retention? Whatever it is, write down your goal. At this stage of writing an OK, focus on the larger picture of the objective of the goal that you want to achieve. In the next step, we’ll get more granular about our key results and define them in a way that leaves no room for interpretation to ensure complete alignment and transparency. Check out our full guide to implementing OKRs in your business.\nNext, figure out your objectives. These are the steps you'll take to reach your goal. For example, if you want to increase customer satisfaction, your objective might be \"increase customer satisfaction.\" Your objectives could include things like \"improve conversion rates by 8%,\" \"reduce churn by 5%,\" and \"increase average order value by 10%.\"\nFinally, identify key results. Key results are metrics that measure whether your organization is achieving its objectives. They show whether you're moving toward your goal. In addition, KPIs help you understand where you stand relative to your competitors. You can use KPIs to compare yourself against industry benchmarks. (Learn about KPIs vs. OKRs and how to use them both)\nMarketing OKR Example\nObjective:\nLaunch a webinar series to engage our target audience better\nKey Results:\nGenerate 300 Sales Qualified Leads (SQL) by the end of the quarter (time-bound)\nProduce $425,000 in new sales pipeline\nHave an average attendance rate of 50%\nSales OKR Example\nObjective:\nReach $3 Million in Annual Recurring Revenue by the end of this quarter\nKey Results:\nClose 5 new logo deals\nAnnual Recurring Revenue per deal of $600,000\nSchedule 25 qualified discovery meetings\nHealthcare OKR Example\nA healthcare organization wanted to increase flu vaccination rates among employees. They identified three areas where they needed improvement:\nObjective:\nTo increase Flu vaccination rates to minimize hospitalizations and sickness.\nKey Results:\nIncrease awareness about the importance of getting vaccinated by 8%\nHave 33% of staff take advantage of on-site vaccination days\nCut sick days of employees due to flu by 5%\nCEO Cascading OKR Example\nA CEO sets his/her own OKRs and measures them against those objectives. This helps ensure that the CEO’s priorities remain consistent throughout the organization. As such, the CEO must understand how each department works and what metrics it needs to meet.\nThe CEO must set OKRs aligned with the company's overall goals and needs to be cascaded. For example, the CEO might set OKRs like this:\n- Increase revenue by 10% per quarter over the next 12 months.\n- Reduce the cost of goods sold by 5%.\n- Improve customer satisfaction by 20%.\n- Achieve operational excellence.\n- Grow market share by 15%.\nThey would roll this cascading OKR down to each team member to know exactly what they need to do to contribute to the success of your business. The individual OKRs cascade deep into the organization to create a clear picture of success; now, you must get in the Rhythm of Work to complete your strategy!\nAs you can see, OKRs are a great way to build a cohesive team, improve productivity, and increase overall organizational effectiveness with our OKR template and expertise in setting key results.

    "content": "How to develop a high-impact team\nCreating the right environment and implementing five key coaching habits are crucial.\n“The Dream Team.” It was the name given to the 1992 US men’s Olympic basketball team composed of some of the greats of the game, including Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, and John Stockton. We’ve seen dream teams in other sports, of course—Brazil’s 1970 football team that won the World Cup; the 1980 USSR Olympic ice hockey “red machine” team; and the US team that won the 2019 Women’s World Cup. We’ve seen dense concentrations of star talent working under the influence of strong leadership in other fields throughout history, too, such as the artists of the Italian Renaissance or the five-time Nobel laureates of the Curie family.\nWe also find dream teams inside our modern workplaces. The best leaders don’t just stumble upon such teams; they know how to build a dream team, even under challenging circumstances. And they do this not by focusing on one or two impact players but by carefully curating team members with the right mindset; developing them as individuals and as a team; and nurturing a robust, healthy culture.\nWhen you’re a leader building a team, sometimes you can recruit and stack the deck in your favor; this is especially likely if you work in an organization that is actively bringing in new talent. However, few corporate managers have the luxury of handpicking and assembling their dream team from the start. More often, you must create your dream team by conjuring brilliance from a group of inherited employees. In this case, it’s your job to grow the talent you already have. To do this, you need to create an environment in which the right mindsets and behaviors can flourish, and then you need to implement five key coaching habits.\nCreating safety that enables stretch\nThe best leaders cultivate a climate that is both comfortable and intense. They remove fear and provide the security that invites people to do their best thinking. At the same time, they establish an energizing, intense environment that demands people’s best efforts.\nWhat occurs when you create only one of these conditions? What happens when you stretch people without first building a foundation of safety, trust, and respect? The onslaught of challenges produces debilitating anxiety rather than growth. On the other hand, if you foster a supportive environment but never ask others to do something truly difficult, your people feel appreciated but stagnant. People perform and grow best with equal doses of safety and stretch.\nFive high-impact coaching habits\nThe following five leadership habits will encourage the right behavior in a team—the first two establish an environment of safety; the last three provide stretch.\nDefine the W.I.N. If you want the people on your team to venture beyond artificial job boundaries and do what’s needed, help them see what’s most important at any given time. Sharing strategic imperatives or annual objectives is a good start, but we all know these goals tend to evolve as the environment changes. You can help your team know where to focus by defining the W.I.N. (What’s Important Now) and keeping it front and center.\nPeople perform and grow best with equal doses of safety and stretch.\nFor instance, when I was working as a vice president of Oracle University, the sheer volume of programs we ran made it difficult to keep our priorities straight. But we needed to shift our energy toward several new initiatives. Instead of calling a management meeting or distributing a document to all staff, I posted three top-priority initiatives on the door of my office. The list was short, probably no more than ten words. Letting people know what’s important doesn’t require elaborate presentations or expensive communication campaigns—you simply need to share what’s at the top of your mental to-do list.\nRedefine leadership. Innovation is increasingly becoming a team sport, requiring diverse perspectives and collective intelligence. These innovation-focused teams tend to be ephemeral. They form, collaborate, and disband quickly. Team members need to be able to step up and step back with equal ease. To participate in this fast, fluid model of leadership, less assertive employees (and those uninterested in careers in management) will likely need help stepping up. To get these reluctant leaders to step up and then step back, provide a path of retreat. Show them that being a designated leader can be a temporary assignment, existing for the duration of a project or even for just a single meeting.\nSome team members will need encouragement and support to become “step-up” leaders, but others will do so with ease. It can take work to then get them to step back and support others. You can help these people develop a more fluid leadership style by modeling healthy followership practices. Let them see you collaborating with a peer organization or contributing to a project led by someone below you in the management hierarchy. Show your team that you can work as passionately as a follower as you do as a leader and that excelling as a follower is part of growing as a leader.\nAsk your people to stay until the job is done. If we want people who work for us to finish strong, we might need to insist that they finish one job before moving on to the next. Consider the story Dan Rose, chairman of Coatue Management, recounted on Twitter about what he learned while working at Amazon.\nIn 2004, Dan jumped at the chance to join the new Kindle team at Amazon. He had been running Amazon’s cell phone store and had steered the business away from potential shutdown and turned it into the fastest-growing segment at Amazon. But over time, Amazon’s competitors had closed in, and growth had stalled. That’s when the offer to work on the Kindle came.\nOne week before Dan was scheduled to begin his new job, Diego Piacentini, Amazon’s worldwide head of retail and Dan’s future boss, called Dan into his office. “He explained [that] you don’t get rewarded with new opportunities when you’re doing a bad job,” Dan recounted. “He would allow me to join [the] Kindle team as soon as I got my current business back on track and hired a successor who was stronger than me.”\nWhen we hold people accountable for finishing their work, we send a powerful message that their work matters and that we believe they are strong enough to stay in the game, even when things get tough.\nProvide performance intel. People generally need two types of information to achieve top performance. The first is clear direction: What is the target, and why is it important? (In other words, the W.I.N.) The second is performance feedback: Am I hitting the target? Am I doing it right? Think of feedback as critical information—data that people need in order to calibrate and adjust their approach—rather than a critique. When feedback is simply much-needed information, and not a personal judgment, the feedback is easier to both share and receive. As my teenage son Josh recently said to me when I brushed off his repeated suggestion that I change a setting on my smartphone, “I’m not telling you you’re an idiot. I’m just giving you important information.”\nState what you appreciate. In my research, I’ve been struck by the number of managers who admit that they’ve never communicated to the people who work for them what they most and least appreciate about what they do. Managers, if you want your staff members to make work light for you and others, make a practice of flagging behavior that you appreciate. When someone does something to make your work easier, say, “When you do X, it’s easier for me to do Y.”\nElise Noorda is the president of a 300-person youth symphony and choir in Las Vegas run entirely by volunteers. Just a few weeks before a performance, the atmosphere was tense because the teenagers were acting like teenagers, which frustrated the adult volunteers. That, in turn, made Elise’s management job even harder.\nOne night after rehearsal, while Elise was meeting with the adults, she spoke to Holly, a volunteer who managed the nightly mid-rehearsal snack break. “Holly, you’re doing a great job,” she said. “You feed 300 people in ten minutes and make it fun. When you create a fun atmosphere during the break, it helps the rest of the rehearsal go smoothly.” The next rehearsal fell on Halloween, and Holly took snack time to a whole new level: festive treats, spooky decorations, and a fog machine. The lightened atmosphere spread through the rest of the rehearsal. The entire team got the message and followed Holly’s example, keeping everyone’s temper down and spirits up for the rest of the season. Elise said, “I let Holly know, in front of a bunch of people, ‘Hey, I love what you’re doing,’ and it affected every area of our work.”\nSustaining a winning culture\nAs you create the right environment and implement these coaching habits, you will start to build something more powerful than a few strong players on your team. You will create a culture—a set of norms and values about how work gets done—that will persist long after your team disperses. Your culture will be filled with a sense of adventure and a productive combination of initiative and accountability. People will have the confidence they need to learn and innovate and the agility to adapt to moving targets. Your organization will have the collective strength to tackle hard problems, navigate ambiguous situations, and pursue opportunities.\nAuthor profile:\n- Liz Wiseman is a researcher and advisor who teaches leadership to executives around the world.

    "content": "Nano Tools for Leaders® — a collaboration between Wharton Executive Education and Wharton’s Center for Leadership and Change Management — are fast, effective tools that you can learn and start using in less than 15 minutes, with the potential to significantly impact your success.\nThe Goal\nHalve the time and double the impact of your meetings.\nNano Tool\nThe world of work will always revolve around people working with people, and meeting together is an important way to get things done, which is why meetings will always be a part of organizational life. But they’re also hated by most people — not because they get things done (which they do), but because they typically waste so much time. Since we can’t get rid of them, the answer is to get better at them by making them more efficient, more valuable, and more concise.\nTake a look at your calendar. How many of your meetings are 60 minutes or more? Imagine how much time you would have to get your work done (or even just have space to think) if they were 25-minute meetings. And imagine how appreciative your team members and colleagues will be for that time when they attend your meetings.\nTwenty-five minutes is not an arbitrary number: there is both art and science involved. Put simply, 25 minutes is practical, easy, and achievable — and it has the smarts to back it up.\nAction Steps\nThere are three steps to the 25-minute meeting roadmap:\n1. Set up\nPurpose. Before you invite people to a meeting, think about why you are having the meeting in the first place. While there are hundreds of reasons people meet, they commonly fall into one of three categories: Inform, Align, or Resolve. For every meeting you organize, finish this sentence: “At the end of this meeting, it would be great if….” Put the result into the meeting invitation. For every meeting you are invited to, ask the organizer (politely) to finish the same sentence.\nPeople. A 25-minute meeting works best for groups of no more than five people. Consider why each person is needed by asking yourself two questions: what role will they play in this meeting? How will they give, or get, value from their time in this meeting?\nProcess. How will we achieve the meeting’s stated purpose? Having a process and a structure to facilitate the discussion means that everyone can contribute evenly, and a free-flowing conversation is effective. A good meeting process follows your agenda, facilitates participation, and serves the outcome of the meeting.\n2. Show up\nPreparedness. Lack of planning and preparation is one of the biggest causes of ineffective meetings. Put the purpose of the meeting in the invite, send out agendas in advance, and make sure people have ample time to review any pre-reading.\nPunctuality. No matter who is in the room, the meeting will start and end on time. There is no repetition for latecomers. By respecting each other’s time and the issue or topic at hand, we create positive feelings toward our teammates. This leads to more open, honest, and candid discussions, which in turn lead to meeting outcomes achieved.\nPresence. Unless you need to show slides or demonstrate something on a computer, meetings should be unplugged: no phones, laptops, or tablets allowed.\n3. Speak Up\nParticipate. Let people know in the meeting invite that they will be called upon for updates, opinions, thoughts, or questions. To help them feel comfortable and engage quickly, consider using a short check-in question or activity (for example, on a scale of 1–10, how are you feeling today?).\nProduce. Use the meeting to enhance work, not prevent anyone from doing “real work,” by following a tight meeting structure. The Scan Focus Act framework (first formulated by Jim Channon, Frank Burns, and Linda Nelson in 1983) keeps meetings on track:\n- Scan. What are we here for? What is the context surrounding the meeting? What do people have to contribute to the discussion? 12 minutes max.\n- Focus. What are the two or three things that require our attention, or are driving our decision-making or problem-solving? Eight minutes max.\n- Act. What else do we need to do? What actions are required? What will happen next? Five minutes max.\nProceed. People should leave the meeting feeling energized and willing to move forward, take next steps, and be clear on what they need to do. That happens with follow-up correspondence.\nAccording to Rocket Meetings, an organization that specializes in productivity, more than 40% of meeting attendees don’t recall what was decided or who should do what after a meeting. In addition, 20% of participants have a different view on what was decided.\n“Put simply, 25 minutes is practical, easy, and achievable — and it has the smarts to back it up.”\nHow One Leader Uses It\nLike many managers, Sandra, a senior design engineer in the automotive manufacturing industry, has most days filled with back-to-back meetings. Most she classifies as formal and not flexible enough to change. But she also has many random meetings that are usually scheduled for 60 minutes, which she decided to change to the 25-minute model.\nShe facilitates the meetings by asking open-ended questions and waiting for people to answer. Although it’s hard to do, she finds silence very powerful, as everyone looks to see who will speak first. The change created a clear improvement in the way the discussions flowed, how people interacted, and even how they committed to the tasks they were given.\nOther concepts she has adopted and now regularly uses include:\n- Sending a short agenda ahead of the event, so participants feel informed and not ambushed, and then keeping to the agenda and only introducing new topics if warranted\n- Arriving early (for both physical and online meetings), looking professional, and not wasting time\n- Taking notes live on the screen or on paper so that everyone has input and agrees on next steps\n- Sending minutes within 24 hours so everyone is informed about agreed deliverables\n- Rescheduling if key people are late or cannot attend; there’s no point wasting people’s time by having the meeting anyway.\nContributor to this Nano Tool: Donna McGeorge, best-selling author of The 25-Minute Meeting (Wiley, 2019) and The 1-Day Refund (Wiley, 2021).\nKnowledge in Action: Related Executive Education Programs\n- Business Essentials for Executives\n- High-Potential Leaders: Accelerating Your Impact\n- Women’s Executive Leadership: Business Strategies for Success\nAdditional Resources",

But they aren’t easy to come by. If you want to win enterprise-level six-figure deals, you need an enterprise sales strategy .\nYou need a strategy that trades quantity for quality. One that has your sales reps focus only on the very best leads. One that sees your reps become trusted consultants.\nIt’s time to talk about target account selling, or TAS.\nTarget account selling is a highly personalized, targeted approach to sales that sees your sales reps focus only on the very best accounts. It can be time-consuming at first (since you’ll need to gather a lot of information), but the pay-offs can be huge.\nWith that in mind, let’s examine what exactly target account selling is and how you can start executing it in your sales strategy today.\nWhat is target account selling (TAS)?\nTarget account selling is a B2B sales methodology that focuses on building and nurturing relationships with strategically chosen, high-value accounts that have a high probability of closing.\nWhat makes these accounts likely to close? Well, they closely match your ideal customer profile (ICP) and characteristics with your top buyers.\nTarget account selling makes accounts even more likely to close by encouraging reps to personalize every interaction throughout the buying process and building long-term partnerships between the buyer and the seller.\nNaturally, all this personalization makes target account selling fairly research-intensive, which is why some salespeople consider it a waste of time. But, as you’ll see below, it can be an incredibly profitable sales methodology when done right.\nWhat are the benefits of target account selling?\nTarget account selling offers three major benefits for sales teams willing to put in the work.\nMove upmarket\nI’m willing to bet that the difference in sales cycle length between your smaller deals and larger deals isn’t much. So why are you wasting time and resources on smaller deals when you could be pursuing much more profitable ones?\nIf the reason is that you can’t add them to your pipeline, target account selling may be the answer. It’s one of the most effective ways of moving upmarket to target bigger and better buyers.\nPart of the reason target account selling lets you move upmarket is that you can spend the time needed to convert high-value accounts.\nBut the TAS process makes you more attractive to these accounts, too. The personalized service that sales reps deliver also improves your company’s reputation. The more buyers who rave about your service, the more attractive to enterprise clients you’ll become.\nLess time spent on poor-quality accounts\nBy its nature, target account selling ensures that your sales reps only spend time on top-tier accounts. Sales reps don’t waste time chasing low-quality leads that won’t close or whose annual contracts are barely worth their time.\nThis isn’t a numbers game — it’s about quality over quality.\nAchieve higher annual contract value (ACV)\nYou’ll generate fewer deals when you use target account selling, but those deals will have a significantly higher annual contract value than previous deals.\nThat’s because you’re removing all of the small deals from your funnel and focusing on the whales — those sales that bring in the bulk of your revenue. Target account selling is the perfect strategy to win high-value, complex sales with multiple decision-makers.\nHow to implement a target account selling methodology in 5 steps\nNow you know the benefits, here’s how you can execute a successful TAS strategy.\n1. Create ICPs and buyer personas\nIt’s essential to know what your target account looks like when running a TAS strategy. So the first step is to create detailed ICPs and buyer personas (also known as customer personas).\nAn ideal customer profile details the firmographic, behavioral, and environmental qualities of your top buyers. These are things like the buyer’s industry, revenue figures, and pain points.\nAsk the following questions to create an ICP:\nA buyer persona describes the decision-makers your team will be reaching out to. It’s much more qualitative than an ICP and includes information like the buyer’s job title, challenges, and goals.\nUse information about your most successful accounts to create both your ICPs and customer personas. But don’t just stop at quantitative data. Ask your current buyers why they chose your solution, what pain points you solved, and which competitors they were considering.\nMake your ICPs and customer personas as detailed as possible.\nThe idea is that you only target accounts that match them because those accounts are the most valuable. While you don’t want to make them so detailed that only five companies in your market match them, you also don’t want to leave any doubt as to what a good account looks like.\n2. Build a target account list\nA target account list is a list of the companies your sales reps will be targeting.\nIf you’ve created detailed ICPs and personas, this list should be pretty easy to create. Only include companies that are a genuine match — you want to prioritize quality over quantity.\nEncourage your reps to learn as much as they can about these accounts and the people who work at them. Check out LinkedIn profiles. Look up the companies on Crunchbase or other data sources. You can even ask existing clients to give you referrals.\nYou’ll want to prioritize accounts at this stage, too. You can do this according to the following criteria:\n- How closely they match your ICP\n- The potential value of each deal\n- The amount of information you have about them\n- Your sales reps’ expertise\n- How likely they are to buy from you\nTry to strike a balance with the number of accounts on your team’s list. Too few accounts will limit your reps’ potential sales. Too many, and your team won’t be able to dedicate the time they need to close each account.\n3. Reach out to targets\nWith a target account list at their disposal, reps need to start making contact with each account. Personalization is essential when you’re only speaking with a handful of accounts.\nCold calling is the best way to reach out to the target accounts on your list. But don’t burn through them — you need to make each conversation count. That’s why it’s important to follow our favorite outreach tips .\nWhen opening, start by using your full name and the company you’re calling on behalf of. This commands respect and establishes that you’ll be the person leading the conversation.\nNext, state the reason for your call.\nOur research shows that stating your reason for calling can increase your success rate by 2.1x. Not bad for one sentence.\nDon’t get carried away, however.\nWe recommend not doing discovery on your first cold call. You want to sell the meeting so that you can gather information. And to do that, you need to talk more — the optimal talk-to-listen ratio for successful cold calls is 55:45.\nThat’s why the best reps speak more than the buyer on the first call. Our research shows that successful cold callers spend more than half the call talking.\n4. Nurture every stakeholder\nThe consultative approach used in target account selling means sales reps need to spend alotof time nurturing buyers. Because your sales team is targeting high-value enterprise accounts, this will often require them to nurture multiple decision-makers simultaneously.\nThe more buyers your reps involve in the process, the more likely they’ll close the deal. Winning deals have at least three people from the buyer’s side involved in meetings.\nWhat’s more, the more people you involve in a deal, the higher value that deal will be.\nDeal value increases when more buyers are involved in the sales cycle. That means your team will need to build multiple case studies.\nThe importance of research in target account selling\nEven if you know the steps to a successful target account selling strategy, you still need to get your research right.\nAccount intelligence\nAccount intelligence is all of the information your reps can find about their target accounts — the list of companies that match your ICP.\nYour reps can do a lot of research before picking up the phone. LinkedIn, Crunchbase, and other sales data sources are the perfect places to start.\nMarket intelligence\nDoes your sales team know what’s happening in the wider market, away from your products and your competitors? They should.\nYour sales team need to be informed about things like:\n- The economy\n- Market disruptions\n- New advances in technology\n- Changing consumer habits\nIndustry reports are a fantastic source of market intelligence. Yes, some of them can be expensive, but there are plenty of reports you can get for free (or in return for your email address).\nCompetitive intelligence\nUnlike other sales methodologies , target account selling requires you to be knowledgeable about your competitors as well as your own product.\nYour competitors’ websites, social media profiles, and marketing resources are all treasure troves of information. But don’t be scared to think outside the box. Maybe the company’s head of sales or marketing has been a podcast guest. Maybe someone from the company has been featured on a webinar talking about their product.\nYou can also reach out to current clients to see if they’ve spoken to your competitors at the same time they’ve spoken to you.\nPrimary research\nAll of the research your team has gathered so far is third-party research based on what other people have compiled. Now it’s time for you and your team to do your own research.\nThis research starts with the data in your own CRM — data that will form the basis of your ICP and customer personas. You want to discover similarities between your best accounts.\nFor instance:\n- What industry are they in?\n- What pain point did you solve?\n- Who did you speak to?\n- Where are they based?\nPrimary research also includes all of the information that your sales team discovers during prospect calls with buyers. This will help them fill in the gaps in their ICPs, identify pain points, and discover other nuggets of information they can use to personalize their pitch.\nBe careful to avoid asking too many questions, though. Our research shows that 11–14 is the perfect number of questions per call.\nGo-to-market outreach\nYou need to have a strong, sales-led, go-to-market strategy to succeed with target account selling. Your GTM strategy will be a clear step-by-step roadmap for launching your product. It will outline which accounts you prioritize and how you nurture them.\nGo-to-market outreach requires you to develop messaging and craft a promotional strategy — both of which will help your sales reps better position your product to clients.\nMove upmarket with Gong\nTarget account selling is successful because of the sheer amount of research it requires reps to do. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t a place for sales software in a TAS strategy. Far from it.

    "content": "7 reasons why you need a recognition culture (and how to create one)\nOur people are human. And humans have needs. Some of these fundamental human requirements show up at the workplace and live in the top tiers of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and come in the form of self-esteem and actualization. A job isn’t responsible for fulfilling all these needs, but let’s be honest — given that the average person spends one-third of their life at work, it is to an extent.\nHow do you create a work environment where your people feel happy and fulfilled? It starts with creating a space where your people feel appreciated and recognized.\nThe importance of employee recognition\nCreating a culture of recognition can save your organization from high turnover costs. Gallup’s studies have found that voluntary employee turnover can cost organizations in the US up to $1 trillion a year. Yet only 23% of employees believe that they receive the right amount of recognition for the work they do.\nIt goes without saying that your people are your most important asset. They make critical decisions on a daily basis that shape your business. And how you as an organization treat your people, and how your people treat others, plays a key role in your success. It’s a chain reaction.\nTo have high-performing teams, employee engagement is vital. A simple act of recognition and appreciation is often all it takes. Employees that receive recognition are:\n- 73% less likely to “always” or “very often” feel burned out\n- 56% less likely to be looking or watching for job opportunities\n- 44% more likely to be thriving in their life overall\n- 5 times as likely to feel connected to their company culture\n- 4 times more likely to be engaged\n- 5 times as likely to see a path to grow at their organization\n- And 4 times more likely to recommend their organization to family and friends\nThe bottom line is that creating an environment that fosters recognition helps with employee retention, productivity, and innovation. Employees that feel valued at work are automatically more engaged, committed, and motivated to go above and beyond to help their organization succeed.\nHow to create a recognition culture\nCreating a culture of recognition doesn’t have to be difficult. But creating a formal “program” isn’t going to do the trick. So no, you don’t need a complex system to execute it.\nA culture of recognition is an environment where gratitude and praise are openly shared and received by leadership, managers, and peers alike. Make everyone feel empowered to acknowledge and appreciate the skillset others bring to the table, celebrate efforts, and a job well done. It isn’t a one-way street; giving recognition is just as important as receiving it.\nBut it’s key that leadership and HR walk the walk. By doing so, everyone will be assured that your company takes recognition seriously. It’ll also create a domino effect; encouraging frequent and open peer-to-peer recognition.\n- How should you recognize people?\nRecognition comes in all shapes and sizes. It doesn’t only need to be given to an individual, it can even be provided to a group of people ie. a team, a squad, tiger team, etc.\nWhile many may associate recognition with monetary benefits, ie. a raise, bonuses, gift vouchers, company perks, etc., it also comes in many different forms. These can include verbal or written praises. Or it can be as simple as a “Thank you”.\n- When should you recognize someone for their work?\nThere’s no formula set in stone — if you see someone doing a good job, behaving in line with values, or doing anything that you feel is worth communicating to the person or sharing with others, the answer is: just do it.\nWhile the mode of recognition and praise may vary from company to company, or even per individual, there are some standard things you can incorporate into your recognition program.\n- Are people aligned and behaving according to your company values? Call it out.\n- Are their achievements impacting your company’s goals and strategy? Give them a shoutout!\n- Is someone doing a great job at the little unseen, mundane tasks? Make sure their efforts are seen.\n- Did someone help you with a project? Say thank you.\nIt’s really the little things that go a long way.\n- How should you share Kudos?\nKeep your eye out for good work. Make sure to integrate giving praise into your daily flows. That could mean sending someone a short message, bringing up their achievements or success in your 1:1s, Performance Reviews, or even in a company All-Hands meeting.\nIn Perdoo we’ve made it easy for you to quickly and transparently share Kudos with your peers. You can “Give Kudos” from within your weekly Check-in form, via a colleague’s or your own profile page, or directly from Home.\nWant to centralize shared recognition? Create a Slack channel dedicated to Kudos and we’ll make sure to help you openly celebrate the hard work of your peers.\nOnce you’ve mastered being aware of those around you and bringing up what’s important to each one of your people, you’ll have created a culture of recognition. Everyone will know that leadership and managers value people as their most important resource. They’ll know that the work they do, and the impact they have on the company’s success will be seen and recognized. As Richard Branson of The Virgin Group said, “Take care of our employees, and they’ll take care of your business.” Guaranteed.\nA few things you should bear in mind\nWe know by now that there’s no one-size-fits-all formula for employee recognition. But to create a continuous environment where your people feel cared for and can be and do their best, here’s what you should keep in mind. When recognizing people:\n- Be personal\nStaying in the loop and conscious of the work others are putting in can be difficult. But this is the only way to truly indicate that you care. So make sure to tie your praise to something that resonates closely with the person or group ie. a specific accomplishment or a business goal that’s been met. Describing what and how their work has impacted an outcome is important. It’ll inspire them to continue their good performance.\n- Be timely\nTiming is key. Receiving praise weeks or months later isn’t as meaningful as praise received right away. Being punctual with acknowledging someone’s hard work will show the employee that it’s authentic.\n- Be genuine\nFrequent recognition is important. Most people want to be recognized at least a few times a month, and this is still on the lower side. Studies have found that there’s no such thing as too much recognition.\nAt the same time that might be tempting to praise others at the drop of a hat. But remember, empty words are almost as good as none. So make sure when you’re recognizing someone that it’s genuine praise tied to something personal. In case you feel you need to work your way around with people, and communicate better with them, a professional coach can be a good consultant on this.",

    "content": "Their remote workforce puts writing first to democratize communication\nFor remote, global teams, asynchronous communication is a given—and learning how to master it is a must. Since its founding 11 years ago, Doist has been a remote-first asynchronous company. Doist started as a productivity app, Todoist, and launched it's second product Twist in 2017, an asynchronous communication tool. As Fadeke Adegbuyi, Doist’s Senior Marketing Manager of Content, tells it, “Relying on synchronous tools has never been an option for us.”\n“When we say that we’re async first, what we mean is that we’re writing first.”\nIt’s no surprise that Doist has taken the problem of remote communication and turned it into a superpower. It’s a huge part of their culture, and as Fadeke says, it all boils down to believing in the power of writing to get aligned and achieve goals: “When we say that we’re async first, what we mean is that we’re writing first.”\nBecause Doist relies so heavily on asynchronous communication, it's important that information is always accessible. In terms of deciding what needs to be written down, the criteria are pretty straightforward. “We approach communication from a beginner mindset,” says Fadeke. That means that the goal is to document answers to questions anyone might have who’s new to the company, a role, or a process. “Even if a process seems obvious or has been done many times before, we want to make sure everything’s in place so that someone who’s new to it gets it,” she says.\n“Writing extends to everything we do—how we update one another on work, how information is passed down from our leadership team, how we brainstorm, and how we have discussions.” says Fadeke.\nWhile writing has always been a big part of Doist’s culture, up until about a year ago, a lack of organization prevented the team from fully harnessing its power. According to Fadeke, “We had a lot of writing, but it was dispersed among many platforms. Some of it lived in Dropbox Paper, some was in Google Docs, some of it was in Twist threads. You would have to check in three to four different places to find what you needed, and there was also some duplication.” There was a strong need for a centralized location where each piece of documentation could live. Then, about a year ago, Doist took a page from the book of another company with a strong writing culture. Gitlab documents all their internal processes and knowledge in a company handbook and makes it available to the public.\nIn an effort to streamline communication and make their documentation more searchable, Doist has developed a handbook that’s housed in GitHub. The handbook includes everything anyone would need to know about working at Doist, and there are years of learning and transparency they can immediately draw upon. Whether it’s reading about the story of Doist, the company’s mission and values, revenue plans for the future, or HR practices and company policies, having access to this from day one lets people know what kind of journey to expect.\n“Now, everything is searchable, which contributes to our culture of transparency. If anyone has a question, it’s likely that they’ll find a document for it.”\nThis initiative has strengthened Doist’s writing culture, and made it clear that having information documented in an accessible, centralized place makes employees more productive and strengthens company-wide transparency.\nFadeke loves the way Doist prioritizes and relies on writing because she believes it makes employees more thoughtful about their work. “Allowing people to take the time to write out their thoughts gives them the opportunity to convey their ideas and express themselves in a way they wouldn’t be able to if they were just talking off-the-cuff,” she says. “People at Doist really have time to think through their ideas and make sure they’re communicating them in the most thoughtful way.”\n“Having a culture that prioritizes writing is a great way to allow everyone to contribute more.”\nFadeke believes that having a writing-first culture democratizes communication at all levels. “Not everyone is extroverted, and some work cultures rely on people raising their hand and speaking up in meetings,” says Fadeke. “Having a culture that prioritizes writing is a great way to allow everyone to contribute more.”\nBecause Doist has always been remote, they've had found a lot of ways to build culture through writing. They do things like weekly Twist threads where people can share highlights from their weekend, or asynchronous, writing-based games of telephone. “Writing extends not just to how we work, but also how we play, and how we get to know one another,” says Fadeke.\nAs for the next few years, Fadeke is confident that Doist’s writing culture will help the company continue to achieve its goals. “We have a wide range of team members from a range of countries, and being async enables us to maintain and grow that diversity,” she says.\n“Other companies are stuck in a pattern where they confuse meetings with work, and that has to change.”\nAt this point, 80-90% of Doist’s communication is done asynchronously, and Fadeke sees this trend expanding in the future. “Writing is imperative to the sustainability of remote working culture,” she says. “Other companies are stuck in a pattern where they confuse meetings with work, and that has to change. Presence is easy to measure, but it’s detrimental to productivity.”\nShe predicts that as workplaces opt to stay remote indefinitely, a shift will occur. “Companies will start putting more trust in employees and allow them to communicate asynchronously,” she says. “We can rely on writing instead.” Doist has proven that operating this way isn’t just sustainable—it’s a superpower.\nEnjoying the post?

They make us more effective too.\nAccording to Harvard researchers, rituals improve our performance in both public and private settings by reducing anxiety and helping us stay clear-headed.\nAt work, rituals help leaders and teams build culture, executive more effectively, and improve teamwork.\nTheyâre especially valuableâbut often challenging to get rightâon hybrid or remote teams, where itâs harder to feel a sense of belonging.\nIn this article, weâll break down how to think about rituals on your own team and share examples of remote and hybrid team rituals to get your started.\nWhat are team rituals?\nTeam rituals are customs your team performs routinely together. Whether youâre aware of it or not, you probably have some team rituals already. Things like a weekly team lunch (virtual or IRL), daily standups, or a new hire onboarding course are all examples of team rituals.\nWhy team rituals are important\nRituals help teams foster belonging.\nIn a recent article, Range co-founder Dan Pupius explains why belonging is something every leader should care about.\nâTeam members need a sense of belonging to feel comfortable. They want to know that their work matters not only to their manager but to their co-workers. Nobody wants to feel like they're not pulling their weight, and when a team is firing on all cylinders, every individual feels like they have a role to play and are vital to the success and happiness of their peers. It's in rituals, both large and small, that team members gain that sense of camaraderie while feeling both supported and valued.â âÂ Dan Pupius, Co-founder of Range, Inc.com\nThe benefits go both ways too. When folks feel valued by the team and leadership, theyâre more likely to feel a deep level of accountability in their work and execute at a higher level.\nWhy rituals are key for remote and hybrid teams\nTo be most creative, you need to feel open and connected to your team.\nWhen you're in the same officeâit happens pretty naturally. You chat with people in the elevator, go out for lunch or a beer after work. You share stories about your life and your history which help people understand and relate to you better.\nFor remote or hybrid teams, rituals can help create some of that same understanding even while being apart. It takes more intention to get to know each other in the same wayâbut the work is critical if you want your team to work effectively together.\nWhen to use team rituals\nTeam rituals can help foster connectedness and engagement during many different workplace moments. Here are a few examples of times when investing in team rituals can be impactful.\n- To build culture and team rapport: Rituals help bring teams together through shared experience, and can be a powerful tool when folks are feeling disconnected or as your team grows.\n- To drive momentum around work and projects: Team rituals can help keep teammates more energized and on-track as they work together to tackle a common goal. They might be process-related, like project kick-offs and daily check-ins, or more celebratory like a weekly moment of gratitude.\n- To onboard new teammates: When new hires participate in rituals, it quickly helps them feel a greater sense of purpose and belonging within the org. For instance, Google new hires wear colorful beanies that say âNooglerâ to initiate them into the groupâitâs a shared experience that connects all employees.\n- To support the teamâespecially during major shifts: Investing in rituals as your team grows or experiences big shifts, like a reorg, can help bring folks together and build a more supportive culture.\nHow to establish the right rituals for your team\nLanding on the right team rituals is an iterative process. Like most new things your team tries, the best way to know whatâs working is to observe and check-in with your team regularly. Here are some questions you can ask yourself and your team as you go.\n- What are we looking to accomplish?\n- What gives each of us energy? Are we a group of introverts? Extroverts? Or (most likely) a mix?\n- Is this activity something people look forward to?\n- After we take part in the ritual, whatâs the impact on folkâs energy and engagement?\n- How did individuals feel about themselves after participating?\n- How did individuals feel about the team or project after participating?\n8 ideas for remote and hybrid team rituals\nVirtual water cooler or coffee chats\nIn an office, youâve got snack kitchens, coffee corners, and break rooms as a space to casually connect with your teammates. When youâre remote or hybrid, itâs important to invest in virtual forums to do the same. Youâll see huge benefits to team trust and connectedness.\nWhether itâs a designated Slack channel or 30-minute Zoom each morning, be sure youâre offering space where teammates can opt-in or out, without worrying that they're distracting others who are focusing on a task.\n�âWe have a #coffeecooler Slack channel, a hat tip to a verbal slip-up one of our founders made during a conference panel a few years back. Finding common ground with co-workers through similar interests and humor immediately makes a team feel more like a family, whether in-person or remote.â âÂ Dan Pupius, CEO of Range\n2. Team all-hands or recap meeting\nComing together to recap milestones and celebrate each otherâs work is a powerful way to reinforce purpose within the team. Depending on your teamâs size and structure, you might choose to hold a team all-hands meeting week, bi-weekly, or monthly.\nAt Range, we hold a bi-weekly cycle recap meeting where we lift up successes, share ânoble failuresâ, and celebrate major milestones together as a team.\n3. Daily team icebreaker\nLooking for a lightweight daily ritual to build team culture and trust? Trying kicking off each morning with a daily team question or icebreakerâitâs fast, fun, and helps folks get to know each other better, which ultimately improves team dynamics.\nOur free icebreaker tool has lots of different questions (serious, fun, and everything in between) to get you started.\nTry our (free) icebreaker spinner today\nKick off your next meeting with one of 300+ icebreaker questions to help everyone feel more connected and engaged.\n4. #Team-gratitude Slack channel\nWhen folks feel recognized for their work on contributions on a regular basis, theyâre more likely to feel a strong sense of purpose and belonging within the team.\nPracticing gratitude for your teammates can increase job satisfaction (), and fuel greater teamwork too.\nSomething as simple as a Slack channel where you tag your teammates to say thanks can be a powerful ritual that shows everyone just how meaningful their contributions are.\nâSetting aside time to express gratitude is great because you can let your teammates know that they had a positive impact on you and your work, and by the same token, you learn how you made someone's day a bit better when you might not have realized it. Giving gratitude is as valuable to the giver as the receiver; gratitude has clear health benefits, helps people cope with stress, and means you will build stronger relationships.â âÂ Dan Pupius, CEO of Range\n5. Social game time\nMany remote and hybrid teams choose group game time as a ritual. Why? Well, not only are games ridiculously funâtheyâre also proven to drive motivation, productivity, and performance.\nOne study even found that new teams perform 20% better on tasks following a 45 minute collaborative game.\nAt Range, we have a 30 minute game time scheduled every Tuesday. Everyone is invited and typically between a third and a half of the team show up each time. Itâs a great opportunity to connect with teammates, have a little fun, and take a break from remote work monotony.\nOnline drawing games are our favoriteâ¦ and weâre always looking for new challengers. ;)\n6. Async daily check-ins\nMany teams choose to create a daily ritual around checking in with one anotherâitâs a great way to keep a pulse on how everyoneâs doing and keep the whole team in-sync.\nWhen youâre all in the office, check-ins might take the form of a daily standup.\nWhen youâre hybrid or remote, checking in usually happens asynchronously\nAsync daily updates can be done directly in Range in less than 5 minutes. They let everyone know what you're working on and what you may need help with, and even include team-building questions to help everyone stay connected.\n7. Creative power hour\nSoundcloud compositions.\nGraphic novels.\nShort-story chapbooks.\nCrocheted stuffed animals.\nNo matter what your teammates create outside of work, setting aside group time to chip away at passion projects is a surefire way to ignite inspiration and bring folks closer together.\nAt Range, weâve experimented with an (optional) biweekly meeting called âThe Creative Range.â\nAnyone on the team can drop in, share a bit about a hobby or interest of theirs, and spend all or part of the hour making progress on a non-work project.\n8. Show & tell\nGet-to-know-you rituals like âshow & tellâ can help teammates learn about each other as people, find common ground, and build understanding.\nAt Range, our version of show & tell is a biannual team zine (short for magazine). Everyone collaborates and contributes in their own way. People draw comics, make infographics, and share stories. We cover a different topic each time, like âHow I spent COVIDâ or âStories from our youth.â\nâShow & tellâ doesn't have to look like a zine, it could be a few slides at a team meeting or a âhow toâ lesson based on a talent or interest â how to ski from a helicopter, make your own wine, or sew a quilt.\nGet your rituals going with Range\nRange makes it easy to connect with your teammates and build belonging through rituals that stick.\nWith Range Check-ins, you can share what youâre working on, see how everyoneâs doing, bond over a team question, and share your gratitude to teammates.\nBuild your rituals with:\n- Lightweight daily progress updates to fuel trust and accountability\n- Culture-building icebreaker questions to get to know each other\n- Mood-sharing prompts (using emojis and colors) to encourage vulnerability\n- Gratitude prompts to show you value each otherâs work\n- Daily reminders to make it easy to build the ritual\n- Plus, check-in via Slack where the conversation is already happening\nRange helps remote and hybrid teams build meaningful rituals and deep connections. All in about 5 minutes each morning.",

If you want #1-7, click here for Part I.\n8. Commitment to a solution\nTop performing salespeople are always committed to staying in their lane and finding a solution for the customer.\nThe commitment to the solution might mean referring that customer to somebody else. It might mean owning up to the fact that you’re not capable of handling it.\nThat is an unwavering support that keeps top performers in the game.\n9. Continuous learning\nThey’re always learning new things about their customers, the industry, and how to work with their customers.\nThey have a thirst to know more information, because that’s how to know they’ve become more valuable to their customers.\nWhat sales skill can you improve for 2023? Check out The Sales Hunter University for masterclass options.\n10. Listening\nWhy should I show up to a customer and just spout off? If all I’m doing is spouting off, they can go to YouTube and find a video on that.\nListening is about dialoguing, understanding, and questioning. The greatest listening technique that top performing salespeople do is: ask a question, and with whatever it is the customer shares, turn around and ask another question to build on it.\nIt’s not about, “Wow, I have this list of 10 questions that I need to power through.”\n11. Support team\nThese are people around that help top performers achieve their tasks. That team might be customer service, your boss, other salespeople, but there’s a support team.\nNow, you may be a solopreneur and you say, “Mark, I am my own salesperson. I don’t have a support team.” In fact you do because you have others around you who you can turn to for guidance.\n12. Having a servant attitude\nIt’s not about you, it’s about putting the other person first. A servant attitude is saying, ‘I’m going to serve other people’.\nI serve on several boards of non-profit groups. Sure, it takes time away from me, but I love doing it because it’s part of my servant attitude. What I’ve found is that the more I give of myself, the more I get back. It’s amazing how I’ve grown personally, professionally, mentally–in so many different ways.\n13. Balance\nDoes balance mean you’re spending equal time doing everything? No, balance means that you have your rhythm.\nIt’s not everything being equal, but they know that when they’re in the groove of spending time with their family, they’re 100% there. And likewise when they’re in the groove working,\nHere are 10 ways salespeople can organize their time and goals.\n14. Optimists play the long game\nPessimists play the short game. “Oh, there’s no deal to be made here. This is bad and that is bad.” Optimists always know that there’s a solution. In addition, they always know that times will get better, and as a result they keep their mindset focused on the long game.\nTalk to the top performing salesperson, and many times they’ll have 25 year goals that they’re going to achieve. Do you?\nDive into short and long-term goals in Mark’s Goal Setting Masterclass. Or get the Annual Planning Masterclass bundled with Goal Setting for the price of one!\n15. Belief in you\nYou believe in yourself, not from an arrogant standpoint, but with a level of humbleness in knowing that you have the ability to impact and influence other people. To do that you must have a strong belief in yourself.\nThat’s not arrogance. It’s really about being authentic, and having a level of trust and confidence that you inspire in others because you’ve already placed it in yourself.\nThis week on The Sales Hunter Podcast…\nWe often ask our customers what their criteria is for bringing in a new vendor, but what about your criteria for a new customer?\nShari Levitin shares her own success with video selling, and how you can take advantage of a skill that is still novel in the industry.\nTune in Thursday, 12/29.\nWhat you missed on Monday…\n10 Reasons to Love Sales\nWhy the best salespeople are passionate about their career.\nCopyright 2022, Mark Hunter “The Sales Hunter” Sales Motivation Blog.

    "content": "The driving force for any business starts with your people. Despite the Great Resignation, and fallout from people wanting to work from home, great people are the energy to grow your business.\nHow you get them is crucial. Few businesses recognize the value meaning and purpose play in their organization acquiring and retaining the Right People.\nYet “Thought Leaders” everywhere agree.\nPurpose and meaning in this current economic environment are more important than ever. So important McKinsey & Company published a series of articles on it, How to lead with purpose, and are publishing a book, Deliberate Calm, in preparation for the volatile times they see ahead.\nThis blog is peppered with comments from authors, leaders, and top thinkers on the importance of purpose and meaning. Perhaps the most acclaimed of these is Simon Sinek’s Start With Why.\nGetting the right people is why we recommend Topgrading to our customers. Your company needs to define your core values and purpose to ensure you know WHO your RIGHT PEOPLE ARE.\nWHO: Do You Fit?\nFit for a specific job is something most businesses do through The Predictive Index or similar tools. If the person must have the right job patterns to fit a specific position, doesn’t it make sense they need to have the right patterns, motives, and emotional makeup to fit into your culture and values?\nHere’s a simple exercise to help make sure the people you hire fit your culture. Once you are sure your Core Values and Purpose are the proper reflection of your business, create 2 or more questions for each value to ask during your interview process.\nTest these with your current Right People. How do they answer these questions when asked? When you are sure the questions are right, and what to expect the answers to be, then ask these with prospective hires.\nThe Heart of Business\nBeyond Simon Sinek’s Start with Why, two books to epitomize the value of purpose in meaning in business are Jim Stengel’s Grow: How Ideals Power Growth and Profit at the World’s Greatest Companies, and Hubert Joly’s recent book The Heart of Business: Leadership Principles for the Next Era of Capitalism.\nJolly shares choosing to view work, not as a curse, but rather as an essential element of our humanity, a key to our search for meaning as individuals, and a way to find fulfillment in our life.\nViktor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning was powerful to him. He discovered we can find meaning in three possible places, work, love, and courage. Often these converge, noting, “doing something significant through work often involves caring for others and overcoming adversity.” Have you not discovered this as well? How can you bring these three together to give meaning and purpose to your business?\nWhen I was an E-Myth Coach one of the most profound, most rewarding, and most meaningful impact tools we used was called Your Primary Aim. It was a full-hour or longer meeting intended to discover the business owner's purpose. Michael Gerber believed the business was meant to give the owner more life. It was critical to discover the owner’s purpose and meaning in life. Joly describes the impact discovering his purpose had for him in the Heart of Business.\nMaking work purposeful for his team at Best Buy was a critical part of turning around Best Buy’s fortunes.\nCould it be critical to you and your business's future as well?\nTo create an environment where everyone is inspired to give their best, contact Positioning Systems today to schedule a free exploratory meeting.\nGrowth demands Strategic Discipline.\nBlame is a waste of time. Guilt has been said to be a worthless emotion. Why is blame wasted time, what are three good reasons never to criticize? Finally, I’ll share a discovery I made that prevents me from saying something bad about anyone, and how you can avoid it as well. We’ll explore all this, next blog.\nBuilding an enduring great organization requires disciplined people, disciplined thought, disciplined action, superior results, producing a distinctive impact on the world.\nDiscipline sustains momentum, over a long period of time, laying the foundations for lasting endurance.\nA winning habit starts with 3 Strategic Disciplines: Priority, Metrics, and Meeting Rhythms.

    "domain": "rhythmsystems.com",

    "content": "At Rhythm Systems, we are all about helping companies and teams achieve their dreams and goals.\nWe have the systems and skills to help them remain focused, aligned, and accountable for getting things done. Developing accountable leaders and teams is a big piece of the puzzle for companies that want to achieve their growth goals consistently. You can be lucky for a while, but you need the right people operating off the right playbook for sustained, predictable success.\nThat's why we've built out a framework for Team Accountability. We call it the 5 Cs: Common Purpose, Clear Expectations, Communication and Alignment, Coaching and Collaboration, and Consequences and Results. On the surface, it's a simple framework, but in practical application, it can change the game for teams and leaders. I love this model because you can apply it universally and gain value from looking at a situation or project through this lens.\nTeam Accountability Framework\nThe best real-life examples of accountability are from our lived experience, so I'll share my story in the spirit of transparency. Last year, my team took on a project to audit and simplify our internal systems. We reached a point where we kept adding on systems, which was too much. We could better scale our operations, be more productive, and save money by making some changes—but change is hard, and our team is hectic. So, to set the project up for success, I launched the new initiative using the framework of the 5 Cs:\n- Common Purpose: Before announcing any changes, I involved all the key stakeholders. I asked them about their current process in our systems and learned what they liked and didn't like. I started by explaining why we were working on the project. I outlined why this initiative was necessary for the longer-term goals of our company, our team, and each individual involved.\n- Clear Expectations: Once we had defined why, we clarified the project's scope. Our cross-functional project team created priorities in Rhythm with Red-Yellow-Green success criteria that clearly outlined our goals, deadlines, and dependencies. We carefully considered the best timing for making changes based on when the team was available.\n- Communication and Alignment: We worked hard to ensure the key stakeholders were informed about critical information and shared information weekly with the broader team in our Weekly Meeting. Since we included quarterly priorities around researching, testing, and rolling out new systems, anyone in our company could review the weekly progress in our Rhythm dashboard. A project like this one impacts all areas of the company; we were changing systems that would impact Sales and Service, and that needed the help of our Finance team. When it came time to roll out the new systems, we did training in a group setting with one-on-one follow-up, and we created written documentation of the steps involved in using the latest techniques. We tried to address the different communication styles and preferences by delivering our message in various ways, and we closed the loop by inspecting whether the team members were adopting the new systems the way we had planned.\n- Coaching and Collaboration: When we found that a few team members needed to start using the new, too, weren't inspected, we reached out to coach them. We asked questions to determine if they were not complying with the latest systems because they needed more skill or understanding. Once we understood the problem, we worked with the person to figure out what else we could do to help them be successful in the new systems. We also had opportunities for the larger team to share feedback and collaborate on best practices in the latest tools.\n- Consequences and Results: We celebrated the success of the nearly year-long effort to streamline our internal systems! Not only did we find ways to save thousands of dollars for the company, but we were also able to point to concrete time-savers and more seamless internal communication that resulted in a better experience for our clients. We celebrated our success in one of our monthly company meetings. All team members must be held accountable to drive performance.\nIf you are intentional at the outset of a new project and use the 5 Cs of Team Accountability as your framework, you can save many headaches. Alternatively, the 5 Cs are also a great coaching tool when things aren’t going according to plan.\nHow to Use the 5 Cs Accountability Framework\nAgain, I will use an example I know well but change the name to protect the innocent. :) A new hire on a sales team - we’ll call him Alex - was a project to make some phone calls to hot prospects on a Friday morning. The following week, the salesperson’s manager - Susan - followed up to see how the calls went, only to find out that the person hadn’t done it yet. Thankfully, Susan had a coach who helped her apply the 5 Cs.\nThey walked through the model together to find where there was a breakdown.\n- Common Purpose: Susan thought it would be evident that it was essential to make the calls so that Alex could close deals, hit his quota, get his commission, and help the company’s bottom line. Hocompany'se didn’t share why it was not to call these people right away - they were hot leads from an event that took place the day before, and if they weren’t contacted soon, they wouldn't lose interest.\n- Clear Expectations: Susan recognized that she had failed to provide a specific time frame for making the calls and had not clearly outlined the process for this particular project.\n- Communication and Alignment: While Susan thought she was communicating clearly by providing a list of names and numbers and asking Alex to make follow-up calls, she realized that she could have slowed down, shared the expectations around getting it done on the same day, and explained why this was important to do now. She also didn’t verify that Alex understood the assignment.\n- Coaching and Collaboration: Upon reflection, it became clear to Susan that Alex wasn't ignoring or intent on letting her down. Susan needed to coach Alex and share responsibility for Alex's poor performance in Alex's case. Rather than punishing Alex for not getting it done, Susan could share that she had failed to communicate well and work with Alex on a plan to ensure they were more closely aligned in the future. She committed to slowing down, and he committed to asking clarifying questions and responding to her requests more quickly when needed. Many teams benefit from skip-level meetings; check out our excellent skip-level meeting questions.\n- Consequences and Results: Alex failed to follow through, so the company missed opportunities. However, Susan had a breakthrough in her management style and learned a valuable framework to help prevent this kind of thing from happening.\nLeadership Accountability\nThinking through this framework can help you as a leader understand where you may play a role in contributing to the problem or where you can better support your team. Using the framework, you can be sure you’ve done everything to set your team up for success. If you continue to have the same problem over and over with the same person, even after running the issue through the 5 Cs, then you can apply consequences - like letting the person go - with confidence that you did all you could to set them up for success.",

    "content": "As I coach leaders around the world and in all kinds of industries, I always find it fascinating to gather as much data as I can. One question I often ask my clients is “What are the obstacles you encounter in working to create a great team?” Here are the four barriers that are cited most often:\nCorporate bureaucracy. Having to work around bureaucracy is one of the top issues I hear about from clients. Why does everything have to be so complicated? While many companies are turning to more flexible models, far too many are still being run as old-fashioned bureaucracies. It’s a structure that stifles creativity, innovation and motivation. It foster blind spots and dehumanizes an organization’s culture. Building a strong team in a bureaucracy is an uphill battle. Any time you’re able to advocate for adopting a more modern structure, give it your all. Meanwhile, you’ll have lots of opportunities to practice patience.\nLack of resources and talent. Many companies can’t properly manage their resources or their people. They don’t know which assets are available or best suited to the task at hand. As a result, resources and talent are spread too thin, causing projects to be understaffed and underequipped. The result? A system of inefficiencies that forces teams to put in longer hours to meet project goals, leading to burnout and frustration. Do what you can within your own team to make sure resources and people are well managed.\nLack of clear direction. Without clear direction and priorities, people don’t know what they should be doing. They aren’t sure what’s urgent or important, and without a big-picture view they end up jumping from one task and one crisis to another. As the leader of your team, you need clear direction from those above you so you can pass it along. If that isn’t happening, provide as much structure and information to your people as you can. A direction that energizes, orients, and engages them will be the foundation of their best work. Teams can’t be inspired if they don’t know what they’re working toward.\nExternal market factors. Effective leaders know how to minimize discouragement and promote positive dynamics. But even the best can’t control market factors and other external issues. There will always be outside factors that impact your team’s work, but by working to build effective controls and a strategic approach you can empower them to bring their best in any situation.\nAt the bottom line, building a great team requires strategy. With careful planning, you can set the right direction, allocate the right resources and talent, and work as effectively as possible around the corporate and external factors you can’t control. Whatever the situation, your strong leadership can drive your team to deliver impactful success.\nLead from within: If you want a great team, eliminate the obstacles that get in their way, so they can stand in their greatness.\n#1 N A T I O N A L B E S T S E L L E R\nThe Leadership Gap\nWhat Gets Between You and Your Greatness\nAfter decades of coaching powerful executives around the world, Lolly Daskal has observed that leaders rise to their positions relying on a specific set of values and traits.

    "content": "Job postings are an art that’s hard to master between getting the details across while keeping it and trying to attract the right candidates to apply. To help you craft a job post that stands out and draws in the best candidates, we asked executives and recruiting leaders for their best insights. From highlighting special job benefits to relying on your humorous take on the role, there are several tips that may help you write the perfect job posting that would naturally draw high-quality applicants to the role being offered.\nHighlight the Special Benefits the Job Offers\nHighlight the culture and special benefits the job offers rather than the wage offered.\nAbout three-quarters of job seekers prioritize work-life balance. They are looking for a better lifestyle that accompanies a job compared to the one they have now. A job posting that proudly touts its supportive culture and policies designed to prioritize a worker’s mental health is automatically appealing to most applicants. You can worry about pay scales once you enter the interview process.\nMonte Deere\nCEO, Kizik\nAvoid Vague Terms and Phrases That Serve No Purpose\nThe term “other duties as assigned” might appease your internal legal eagles, but the phrase is as useful to candidates as “references available upon request” is to hiring managers.\nWhen designing job descriptions, ditch the corporate speak and lose the laundry list of nice-to-have skills. Instead, break down the role by core activities and designate the percentage weight of each (time or value).\nThis mimics the performance standard and sets the employee up for success. Yes, needs and expectations will change over time, but if you can’t articulate what you actually require today, how will you ever find it?\nTim Toterhi\nCHRO, Science and Medicine Group\nPlace Key Information in the First Paragraph\nFirst impressions are crucial. You want to give the candidates all the important information about the job quickly. Speak plainly and give all potential recruits everything they need within the first few sentences.\nThe key information that needs to find its way to the first paragraph are the job title and description, salary range and whether it’s an in-person or remote job. Do that, and you will already stand out among other recruiters writing job ads.\nMaciek Kubiak\nHead of People, PhotoAiD\nShare Insights into Basic Competencies for the Role\nFar too often, job postings list an endless string of qualifications and credentials “required” for a specific role. While some professionals (physicians, CPAs, attorneys) absolutely need specific certifications or accreditations, most do not.\nProviding a realistic idea of what the person will actually do in the role, like projects they may work on, problems they will solve and challenges the business faces are much better ways of describing “a day in the life” versus listing criteria.\nAdditionally, it’s critical to understand how we deliver our work. Interaction and partnership are key predictors of success or failure in any given organization. Two equally credentialed individuals can work in the same place, have the same boss, and work on the same things. One may be wildly successful while the other fails. Why? Because it’s how we do our work that matters.\nSharing insights into the competencies necessary for success within the job posting is a gift you can give your candidates.\nBarbie Winterbottom\nFounder and CEO, The Business of HR\nAlign Your Job Posting to Match Your Audience\nYou should always align your job posting with what your target recruit looks like.\nFor example, when I recruit labor for the summer months, I try to recruit a couple of college students. In my emails and ads, I usually write something about making money during your summer. Many college students need employment during the summer, which allows them to leave in August when they return to school. They want a little extra work while they’re out, so I put that idea in their head when they read my ad.\nAlways craft your ads to match your audience.\nRick Berres\nOwner, Honey-Doers\nBe Upfront and Transparent About the Salary Range\nWhether or not you can offer Silicon Valley salaries, being upfront and transparent about the salary range of your job opening is worth it. Every serious candidate will Google your company before sending their application or interviewing with you, and they will already have a pretty accurate expectation of the salary.\nYou can decide to either come across as the employer that hides things from their employees or as one that’s open and honest in their communication. Only one of these will positively surprise candidates, leading to positive word of mouth.\nThe added benefit of salary transparency is removing a lot of clutter from your process and saving hours and hours of everyone’s time. Suddenly, all of your candidates will be relevant seniority-wise, and you diminish the risk of losing candidates at the finishing line because of compensation misalignment.\nMax Korpinen\nCo-Founder and CEO, Hireproof\nSkip the Bullet Points and Focus on the Story\nAlthough we often hear that bullet points are a great way to summarize information into short, concise pieces, the problem is that we overuse them. As a result, we get lists of data points about the employer, but no authentic stories we can identify with.\nHumans were designed to pay attention to stories. So, instead of using a million bullet points on your next job posting, consider asking your hiring manager the following questions (record the conversation and use an edited version of their answer as the job post):\n– How would you explain what the person in this role does?\n– Describe what happens on a normal day in this role.\n– After one year in this role, how will someone know they’re doing a great job?\nYou can certainly still use bullet points—we do all the time when we write our clients’ job posts. But the key is to focus on the story version of the job. It will give you an edge in the crowded world of job posts.\nJustin Vajko\nChief Creative Officer, Dialog\nFocus on the Impact the Candidate Will Have on Your Department and Company\nImagine you apply for a job, and you already know what you will be doing. You know what you’ll be owning one, three, and six months from now. A high-performer who cares deeply about their career trajectory will probably ask these questions in an interview, but if they have the information up-front and in black and white, their impression of the company will probably be a lot better compared to the companies that don’t volunteer this information upfront.\nWhat is an impact job description? How do you make one?\nWhen crafting a job description, focus on the *impact* a candidate will have on the department they’ll be responsible for and the company as a whole. Showcase the previous growth and clearly outline the desired outcomes a candidate can have influence over. Demonstrate the strengths but also the weaknesses of your company and allow the candidate to focus on the places where they can improve and take ownership of tasks that their skills align with.\nGordana Sretenovic\nCo-Founder, Workello\nMake Your Posting Concise\nHaving been in talent acquisition for over a decade, I’ve seen over a thousand job postings. In my experience, shorter job descriptions get a greater number and better quality applicants.\nThink about it this way, match.com required people to fill out detailed profiles and fill out their preferences across various dimensions—and then came Tinder—sometimes less is more.\nAtta Tarki\nExecutive Chairman, ECA Partners\nTout Your Dynamic and Diverse Work Environment\nWe foster an environment of diversity and inclusion in our company. That’s something that young professionals search for when they seek new employment. It’s a top priority for them.\nThey don’t want to get hired at a place where everyone looks the same and has the same background as they do. They want to learn from and be there for one another—and the workforce needs to embody all of that. Your workforce should includes a broad mix of socioeconomic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds.\nWhen candidates notice that, they are more likely to share those postings with other people who prioritize diversity the same way they do.\nEmily Saunders\nChief Revenue Officer, eLuxury\nUse Humor to Skyrocket Engagement\nGetting seen on the Internet, or “going viral,” relies on creating a job posting that people want to read, and comedy is key to making a post spread like wildfire. The trick is to advertise your position in a way that doesn’t obscure the actual role but still injects a bit of levity into the position.\nI recently placed a candidate in a sales role that was cheekily advertised as a “Customer Wrangler.” In a funny way, that’s exactly what sales are all about, and the posting attracted a wide range of applicants with top-notch people skills.\nRob Reeves\nCEO and President, Redfish Technology\nAuthors\nRecruit Smarter\nWeekly news and industry insights delivered straight to your inbox.",

    "content": "Anthropologists have uncovered Paleolithic grave sites which include tools, an ax, some clothing, and a pouch with berries and dried venison. Sites like these are scattered across Europe and Asia.\nBut they don’t make sense.\nWhat’s to be gained by throwing away good food and valuable tools?\nWhy would undeveloped Neanderthals bury their dead with such ceremony?\nAuthors Adrian Gostick and Chester Elton from All In: How the Best Managers Create a Culture of Belief and Drive Big Results offer the best-educated guess: Early man wanted to help the departed meet whatever adventures lay ahead on the other side with weapons and food. It seems Neanderthals devised a system of thinking that assured them that death could be survived. They had come to trust their world was not chaotic but governed by a powerful force one could appeal to through pragmatic measures. This suggests that as soon as early men began to behave like human beings, they began to wonder about the mysteries of existence, try to make sense of the world around them, and form their own beliefs.\nFor thousands of years, our species has searched for meaning in being part of something bigger than ourselves. It is part of the human condition; we all want to be a contributing part of a community—whether civic, religious, ethnic, political, or social.\nWe all strive to believe in something.\nWhat’s the implication?\nThere’s a path to a hidden reservoir of drive and dedication in your people, a process from which seeds of a strong culture can begin to grow.\nThe Belief Factor: The Secret Sauce That Makes a Culture Contagious\nBelief at work is a choice.\nThe first step to becoming a leader who can influence others to believe is to do something very un-manager-like: pause and think about human nature. Why do people believe in the things they do? And how can they be persuaded to change what they think?\nLeaders too often ask their people to agree with the strategies, policies, and goals of their culture without really knowing how to persuade them.\nHave you ever heard someone say of a leader, “they’d walk through walls for him/her!”\nMany organizations don’t understand the power of Purpose. Yet they probably have leaders in their organizations who instill this, “walk through walls” attitude, inspiration, and loyalty.\nUnfortunately, when a leader like this walks out the door, his team’s loyalty, dedication, and determination usually leave with them.\nWhy Power\nAs we’ve shared in Willpower Rules Your Performance, willpower is finite. Why power breaks down walls, walks through walls, and gets shit done.\nPurpose/Why Power is a force multiplier, an intangible factor increasing performance through inspiration.\nForget about willpower. It’s time for why-power.\nYour choices are only meaningful when you connect them to your desires and dreams. The best leaders and organizations understand this.\nIn a 2001 study by the University of California at Los Angeles’s Eric Flamholtz on a midsize industrial firm with twenty divisions all doing similar work. He discovered the departments whose behavior was most consistent with the company’s desired culture had a better financial performance. The lower-performing divisions did not have cultural buy-in. The findings for this $800 million firm were so striking the company immediately added “effective culture management” to every manager’s performance management system and bonus calculation.\nThe level and impact of just one manager might shock you.\nEmployees are more insistent than ever that their managers see into the future and do a decent job of addressing the coming challenges and capitalizing on new opportunities.\nAll In: How the Best Managers Create a Culture of Belief and Drive Big Results shares, “the best cultures are places of truth, of constant communication, and of marked transparency. Managers in these cultures share even the hard truths with their employees as soon as they can, and they encourage debate even if it rattles harmony. They leave the “pillows” at home; in other words, they don’t soften the blows. Employees know that their managers will be truthful and direct, and that builds trust and a larger culture of openness. Partner with your talent. Great managers think differently about their employees. They believe their success is a direct result of their people’s unique ingenuity and talent, not their own brilliance…….they treat people like true partners and have a sincere desire to create opportunities for them to grow and develop—thereby retaining the best.\nBefore employees will buy into a culture, they must be able to answer the WIIFM question: “What’s in it for me?”\nIn the highest-performing cultures, leaders not only create high levels of engagement—manifest in strong employee attachment to the company and a willingness to give extra effort—but they also create environments that support productivity and performance, in which employees feel enabled. And finally, they help employees feel a greater sense of well-being and drive at work; in other words, people feel energized.\nBest Leaders Ask Two Questions\nThe best leaders regularly ask themselves two questions:\n- “What do I have to do right now to help my people do their best?”\n- “What should I not do right now to help my people do their best?”\nE + E + E\nThree ways employees must feel for you to have a true culture of belief: engaged, enabled, and energized.\nEngaged. They understand how their work benefits the larger organization. Have a clear understanding of how they are responsible and accountable for real results. They can see the value of their contributions to the company’s larger mission.\nEnabled. The company supports employees with the right tools and training. Leaders spend 75 percent of their time coaching and walking the floor to ensure that workers can navigate the demands of their jobs.\nEnergized. Leaders maintain feelings of well-being and high levels of energy through daily productivity contests, helping employees balance work and home life. They recognize individual contributions.

    "content": "How to Unleash Human Potential by Running Teams in Flow State\nChallenge\nIn today’s increasingly disruptive, uncertain, and complex business environment, the pressure to rapidly innovate, adapt to change, and do more with less is greater than ever. In order for companies to remain competitive, people managers must create a work environment that attracts the best talent and engages them so completely that they produce their best work. People managers facilitate this outcome by building talented teams and running them in an optimal state of consciousness where they perform at their best. Running teams in these optimal states, often referred to as flow states, is beneficial because it increases intrinsic motivation, learning, creativity, productivity, trust and overall wellbeing.[i] In group flow state, teams are intellectually and emotionally synched up in a psychologically safe work environment where everyone knows each other’s strengths and weaknesses. Also, while working in group flow, the team has clear goals and a blended ego, and they’re able to adapt to changing demands and creatively problem solve at the highest levels of performance. This type of team is the holy grail for people managers, particularly in environments where rapid adaptation and innovation is paramount to maintaining competitive advantage.\nBusiness Case\nRunning teams in flow state increases the rate of learning, productivity, creative problem solving, the quality of the work produced, positive brain chemistry, and the subjective enjoyment of the work experience. The Flow Genome Project, led by Executive Director Jamie Wheal, notes the following when articulating the business case for having managers run their teams in flow states[ii]\n• 500% increase in productivity for senior executives – McKinsey, 10-year global study of top executives\n• 70% boost in employee productivity and focus – Google\n• 3 days of heightened creativity after a flow state experience – Harvard\n• 430% increase in creative problem solving – University of Sydney\n• 490% faster skill acquisition – Advanced Brain Monitoring & DARPA\n• Increased employee satisfaction and sense of meaning from work – Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\n• “Flow state percentage is the #1 management metric for the 21st century” – James Slavet, Greylock Partners\nFlow\nFlow state, defined as an optimal state of consciousness where we feel and perform at our best, is key to optimizing individual and team performance in the workplace. In a 10-year study, top executives reported being five times more productive in flow, leading researchers to conclude that a 15-20% increase in time spent in flow could close to double overall workplace productivity[iii].\nFlow, through a cocktail of potent neurochemicals, provides access to one of the most gratifying, meaningful, productive and autotelic states available. Think of a time when you were so focused on the task at hand that you outperformed your expectations, lost track of time, and really enjoyed the activity. In flow state, norepinephrine hones your focus, which is necessary for data acquisition. Dopamine improves pattern recognition necessary for mental data processing. Anandamide accelerates lateral thinking, which widens the database searched by your mind’s pattern recognition system. Endorphins help to modulate stress levels, keeping you calm along the way. And finally, serotonin supports feelings of bliss, peace, tranquility, love and attachment, making the individual or group experience intrinsically rewarding. “Researchers describe flow as the source code of intrinsic motivation,” says Jamie Wheal, Executive Director of the Flow Genome Project. “Once an experience produces the state, we will go to extraordinary lengths to get more of it.” [iv]\nThe term flow was selected by Professor Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a University of Chicago research psychologist[v], and is considered an optimal state of brain function. The technical term is “transient hypofrontality,” with “hypo” (meaning slow) being the opposite of “hyper” (i.e., fast) and “frontal” referring to the prefrontal cortex. The state initiated by transient hypofrontality is called “flow” because it causes awareness, decisions, and actions to flow seamlessly into one another. Steven Kotler, author of The Rise of Superman: Decoding the Science of Ultimate Human Performance and one of the most vocal flow advocates, simplifies the neuroscience to the following description: “As attention heightens, the slower and energy-expensive extrinsic system (conscious processing) is swapped out for the far faster and more efficient processing of the subconscious, intrinsic system.” [vi] In flow states, parts of the brain that handle time and ego go dormant; there is a loss of awareness of the self and we silence the inner critic. As a result, we perceive a shift in motivation and all aspects of mental and physical performance are amplified.[vii] A flow experience is marked the following characteristics: selflessness, timelessness, effortless, and richness.[viii]\nNarratives for People Managers\nThe following flow guidance provided in this article is intended to be used by people managers to design work environments that foster flow so they can run teams in states of peak performance where employees are feeling exceptional and operating at their best.\nFlow can occur in both individual and team environments. Individual flow is an experience which a person performs at his or her peak, whereas team flow is a shared, collective experience of flow in which a team performs at its peak.[ix] The three quotes below are provided for people managers who are interested in articulating a narrative about flow to their teams while implementing flow triggers.\n[Jamie Wheal and Steven Kotler discussing SEAL Team 6 and flow] Prevailing through chaotic combat conditions requires an astounding level of cognitive dexterity and almost superhuman teamwork. SEALs have to be able to stop acting like individuals, and start operating as a single entity, almost on demand…“More than any other skill, SEALs rely on a merger of consciousness—‘flipping the switch,’ that’s the real secret to being a SEAL.” – Seal Team 6 Commander[x]\n“Team flow is about a number of individuals who can authentically be themselves in the team. The more team members can be themselves within the team, the easier it is for the team to achieve team flow. Connecting with each other based on a shared intrinsic motivation and the recognition of each other’s skills empowers team members to be themselves because it allows them to act on what motivates them intrinsically and lets them feel appreciated for who they are and what they can do[xi]” –Frank Heckman, Organizational Researcher\nTeam Flow is considered by some leading experts as the best available indicator of holistic team effectiveness and health: “Team flow is the best available indicator of team function, useful long before other indicators (low performance, low engagement or motivation) reveal themselves. Team flow is a highly sensitive indicator of team functioning. This makes it a useful tool for assessing and improving team (dys)function” – Jef J.J. van den Hout, Ph.D.\nFlow Triggers\nFlow states have triggers, or pre-conditions that lead to more flow. Flow arises when our attention is focused in the present moment. Flow triggers drive our attention to the here and now. By considering individual and group drivers which contribute to flow, people managers can encourage team members to transition into a flow state and remain in this state longer.[xii] For example, a manager might set up working sessions for their team to review individual and group flow triggers (listed below) and then work as a team to use these flow triggers where possible during individual and group working sessions.\nIndividual Flow Triggers\nTeam Flow Triggers\nSuggested Next Steps\nIf you’re interested in increasing your individual and team potential for innovation, productivity and satisfaction, by bringing flow triggers to your colleagues, here are some suggested next steps.\n1. First, make sure basic needs are met before trying to facilitate peak mental performance. Establish a strong foundation for yourself and your team. Follow Maslow’s Hierarchy and begin to address physiological, safety, love and belonging, esteem, self-actualization, and self-transcendence needs[xiii]. Also, address some of the needs outlined by Dr. Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz in their Corporate Athlete concept: emotional, intellectual, physical and existential needs[xiv].\n2. Share this article detailing flow triggers with your team and ask for suggestions for using flow triggers on the team.\n3. Use the flow trigger tables in this article. They’re formatted to paste into two PowerPoint slides. Set a weekly working session with your team aimed at embedding flow triggers in individual and group work.

    "content": "Effective leadership meetings are crucial for creating a seamless process and getting company initiatives across the finish line. Unfortunately, they can get sidetracked and go off the rails.\nWhen run well and geared toward specific meeting goals, leadership meetings can inspire ideas, motivate actions, and clarify expectations for your leaders.\nHow can you run meetings that help, instead of annoy your very valuable (and often highly paid) leadership team?\nâThe price of misused executive time is high. Apart from the frustrations that individual managers suffer, delayed or distorted strategic decisions lead to overlooked waste and high costs, hastily conceived and harmful cost reductions, missed new product and business development opportunities, and poor long-term investments.â â âStop Wasting Valuable Timeâ, Harvard Business Review\n7 best practices for high-quality team leadership meetings\nLetâs get down to the nuts and bolts of how to plan, schedule, and run meetings that energize your leadership team and make a measurable difference in how quickly and successfully your team achieves its goals.\nWe recommend these seven actionable steps to create high-value meetings for your leadership team.\n1. Prepare a high-quality meeting agenda\nâThink about the why, the purpose of the gathering, and get really clear on what you want to accomplish from an outcome standpoint. How do I measure this meeting as successful?â â Douglas Ferguson, Founder of Voltage Control\nCreating a meeting agenda is a must-have, cannot-live-without component of successful leadership meetings. Not having an agenda sets the entire meeting up to become an off-topic, disengaged, rambling mess.\nUse a meeting agenda template (Range has an awesome one here) to ensure everything that needs to be covered in the meeting is included.\nIdentify the meetingâs goal, list all the questions you want to be answered (including the person you expect to be involved in discussing each question), and designate the amount of time you expect each point to take.\nOnce you write everything down, read over it carefully and remove the topics that you can handle in an email or during one-on-one meetings.\n2. Send the agenda in advance\nâFor most meetings, getting peopleâs thoughts and ideas asynchronously ahead of time and then coming together to review them is most effective.â â Brett Berson, Partner at First Round Capital\nEffective meetings require preparation.\nEmailing everyone an agenda right as they log onto the video conference for a remote meeting is too late: Nobody wants to be put on the spot or caught off guard without ample time to prepare.\nFinalized meeting agendas should be sent out to participants a full day in advance or earlier.\nThis way, everyone can actively participate and knowledgeably explain and discuss their assigned portions. In addition, everyone can have their questions ready in advance.\nWhen everyone receives the meeting agenda in advance, it sets the tone for an effective meeting that doesnât stall or go off the rails with unrelated discussions.\n3. Highlight wins and accomplishments\nDonât automatically suck the air out of the room by diving into the problems and obstacles. Starting your leadership meetings with positive news and updates gets everyone excited and engaged.\nGo around the meeting and let everyone share something positive their team has accomplished. The news may be major, like completing a lucrative project, or minor, like finishing an unpleasant task.\nEither way, good news gives everyone a chance to know about things going on in other departments and creates camaraderie within the leadership team.\nThey can then take updates back to their team to help break down cross-departmental silos.\n4. Choose a meeting facilitator and note taker\nA facilitator keeps the discussions moving and on topic, saving time and increasing the meetingâs effectiveness. Instead of the most senior team member always running the meeting, shake things up and keep them interesting by taking turns.\nThis way, participants stay on their toes and are involved while honing their leadership skills.\nThere needs to be a separate note taker, too. This person logs topics, ideas, action items, deadlines, follow-up ideas, and the people accountable for each in your companyâs management tool software. These notes serve as your single source of information for the meeting, keeping everyone on the same page and working uniformly.\nAdd the assigned facilitator and note taker to each agenda so that meeting attendees know their roles and responsibilities.\n5. Be respectful of everyoneâs time\nâTry having a set of phrases that you keep in your back pocket that everyone can use.\nSomething like âWe have 20 minutes left and I know we wanted to get to 3 more topics. Are those still things we want to cover today?â\nIt makes it easier when thereâs a power dynamic because it feels less personal and more like a team norm.â â Jean Hsu, VP of Engineering at Range\nOne of the easiest ways to put a damper on team enthusiasm and make leadership meetings points of misery is having them drag on past the scheduled time.\nThese meetings include senior company employees, making them expensive endeavors. Itâs your responsibility to keep the conversations clear, relevant, and engaging within the confines of the agenda.\nFacilitators should be comfortable shutting down tangents and steering everyone back on course. If topics go over the allotted time, curb the discussion and add them to the next meeting, or ask the involved participants to schedule another meeting to hash out the details.\nKeeping meetings on topic and staying on time takes the dread out of meetings. By creating trust within the team and maintaining everyoneâs engagement and focus, you can avoid them thinking, âwell, here goes two hours of my life that I'll never get back.â\n6. Summarize each agenda item after covering it\nEvery discussion should be introduced, discussed, and summarized. This process allows everyone to understand the insights and decisions from the discussion. Summarizing each point also helps the note taker fully flesh out the details of the topic that may not have been clear during the back-and-forth discussion.\nA summary is essential for clarity and laying out the natural next steps of the agenda topic or idea.\n7. Keep things positive and optimistic for the future\nMake a point to start positively and end positively. Graciously close the meeting by thanking everyone for their time, reiterating the meetingâs purpose and what it accomplished, and your confidence in each team member successfully driving their tasks and projects forward.\nEnding meetings on a positive note helps instill confidence and hope in each leader, who can then take the attitude back to their individual teams. This wrap-up is especially important if some discussions get heated or intense during the meeting.\nWhat should leadership meetings include?\nResearch finds that most workers (82%) spend up to 30% of their week in video meetings. Make this investment of time count. Productive meetings arenât going to happen just because you wish they would. There are necessary elements that go into creating effective meetings. Four components for creating better meetings for your senior management are:\nAn enterprise-wide view of the team\nNobody wants to go into a work situation where theyâll be surprised. Kick off your leadership meetings with clarity. Every participant should know the other attendees, their titles, and why theyâre there. Understanding the players and what they bring to the table are the building blocks for digesting contrasting points of view.\nInclude a list of the participants on the leadership team meeting agenda to inform and prepare everyone.\nThis point means crossing off team members who wonât be able to contribute to the leadership meeting.\nDonât waste your executivesâ valuable time by inviting people who won't directly impact your outcome.\nTeam metrics (progress, updates, and roadblocks)\nâIâve found that, as a leadership group, if we align on clear goals at the onset of a quarter or project we can then allow the teams to figure out how to achieve those goals themselves.â â Chris Bee, CTO at Lessen\nFollowing up on progress made since the last meeting should be front and center in every discussion.\n- What is working? What is not?\n- Where are projects stuck?\n- What are the problem-solving ideas to overcome these obstacles?\n- Are projects on track to meet their deadlines?\nLeadership should give a succinct, honest narrative that explains how their team has or hasnât moved projects forward and why. All the explanations should go into the meeting notes for reference.\nDecision-making around questions and items\nâDistinguishing between run and change the business efforts helps the executive team [...] align around their purpose and intent as a group. Often this leads to a realization that they need to focus more of their team time on changing the business. Yes, they still need to monitor operations and remove roadblocks, but they also need to delegate run-the-business issues whenever possible.â â âHow to make the most of your executive team meetingâ, Bain & Company\nAfter the initial check-in on progress, include a key decision discussion on the agenda. Company leaders are the ones most knowledgeable about the company and the direction it needs to head, so capitalize on this expertise.\nWhile meetings should address short-range and upcoming initiatives, they should be vehicles that keep the leadership team aware of long-term goals and strategies.\nMeeting topics like pricing structures, yearly revenue goals, operational improvements, and other key performance indicators (KPIs) are critical to keeping the company competitive and viable.\nAction items for success\nA common mistake is treating a leadership meeting as a stand-alone event when it should function as a GPS, a navigational tool.\nIt should show leaders where they are and direct them to where they want to go. Meetings that leverage past meetings and keep everyone focused on company-wide goals are the most efficient and productive.\nTaking notes during meetings is one of the best ways to make this happen. Notes allow participants to reference and review the topics previously discussed (either in real time or asynchronously). Thorough, detailed notes with deadlines and related tasks assigned to the accountable person maximize the chances that the topics and ideas discussed in the meeting come to fruition.\nUsing a meeting tool like Range helps executive teams stay in the loop and actively involved in achieving targets designated in leadership meetings.\nUse Rangeâs leadership meeting agenda for your team\nEffective leadership meetings donât just happen.\nThey require a solid agenda, advanced preparation, engaged participants, and a clear purpose. When all these components are present, you will focus your leadership team meetings on the most important items.\nThis clarity allows them to guide their teams efficiently, driving company initiatives forward.\nCould you use a robust tool to help you plan your leadership meeting agenda and keep everyone informed with follow-up and next steps?",

    "content": "Recap on the Basics of Core Values\nCore Values are the principles of behavior that are central and defining to your organization. They are your non-negotiables, and they apply to each person in the organization. This article provides tips on how to better communicate core values of your organization.\nIf you are starting your strategic planning from scratch, we recommend dedicating a specific process to articulating your values. Your values (and how consistently and authentically you live them) will, in large part, dictate the culture of your organization.\nWe have outlined a formula for how to write core values that will help them be as specific and actionable as possible. You can read more about how to write core values, and you can see some 40 examples of core values here.\nHow to Communicate Core Values\n#1 Roll Them Out During Your Strategic Planning Process [Or Review Them]\nAgain, if your organization is working from scratch on its strategic plan, we would highly recommend dedicating a separate process—aside from your mission and vision statements—to determining your core values. This stage can be a great time to involve other members of the organization. For example, you could send out surveys to ask employees for their ideas about what behaviors exemplify the values you’ve identified. Use those answers in the anatomy of the core values to specify the behaviors you want to see.\nIf, on the other hand, you’ve already determined your core values as you set about the strategic planning process, great. This is a prime opportunity to review them and to ensure that your mission statement, vision statements, and goals are aligned with these core values. This can be a valuable check on your strategic planning process, and it can also give you better insight into your core values and whether they need to be revised for greater authenticity or specificity. Check out this post if you need help on how to identify your core values.\nGet the Free Guide to Identify and Live Your Core Values\n#2 Ensure They’re in Your One-Page Strategic Plan!\nOf course, your values themselves won’t do much good if they are not communicable. Remember that these values determine behavior for every single person in the organization, not just leadership. That means they need to be in a format that facilitates easy access and understanding.\nIf you have pages and pages of values, mixed in with other foundational elements of your strategic plan, you are likely to lose the essence of your values and strategic plan in general. We recommend keeping your list to 5-7 individual values. Along with making each values statement clear and concise, this will allow them to be placed on a single page with your mission and vision statement.\nDesign this single-page plan with clarity, simplicity, and attractiveness in mind. A one-page strategic plan is easy to distribute and refer to frequently.\n#3 Put them Somewhere Visible\nBrevity and clarity in your core values also enables you to display those values more effectively. Place copies of your core values statements in key places around your organization where you know they will be seen often. You don’t want them to be “out of sight, out of mind.” Having them visible to everyone on a daily basis not only makes sure they are remembered, but also communicates your commitment to them as an organization.\n#4 Make a Core Values Playbook\nWe recommend creating a kind of playbook for each of your core values. This playbook would include a myriad of examples of that core value in action, making it\nTo the extent possible, frame these “plays” in the familiar context of your own company. That might mean you use real past examples of value-centered behavior from within your organization. This makes your values and desired behavior relatable and easy to visualize for each member of the organization.\nHow to Reinforce Your Core Values\n#5 Integrate a Review into Your Staff Meeting\nCore values are integral to company culture, and therefore should not be limited to a one-time discussion. Find ways to revisit and discuss your core values regularly. Preferably, these opportunities should make the values “real” by identifying specific and tangible behaviors that exemplify your values. You want to bridge the gap between theoretical, abstract language and actual behavior.\nOne method of reinforcing your core values is to include them in your regular staff meetings. For example, you might choose one core value to highlight as part of a weekly staff meeting at the beginning of each week. This gives your organization a chance to look for examples of that value throughout the week, so they can be positively called out in the staff meeting (more on that below).\n#6 When You See Something that Represents Your Core Values, Call it Out!\nIt can be immensely powerful when organizational leadership calls out specific and positive examples of employees demonstrating core values. When you give public recognition, you are reinforcing behaviors you want to see across your organization. It is also a motivating experience for employees to feel seen and valued for their efforts. This is one way to communicate your values and your commitment to them.\nOf course, there will be times that you need to address behaviors that don’t align with your organization’s core values. However, these conversations ought to be kept private.\nRemember that, as a leader, your own actions are another important communication of your values. As you go about your day, look for ways that you can be an example of demonstrating core values in your work. Make the connection explicit by discussing how core values influence your decisions and behavior.\n#7 Create a Dedicated Chat/Teams/Slack Channel\nBesides formal meetings, you can send out periodic messaging dedicated to reinforcing core values through a separate channel on Slack, Teams, or other chat channel your organization uses regularly.\nA dedicated chat channel is also a great place to call out positive examples of demonstrating core values—and here, you can communicate those positive reinforcements immediately, rather than waiting until the next weekly staff meeting.\nHow to Create Experiences with Your Core Values\n#8 Create Experiences that Reinforce Your Values\nBehaviors are motivated by belief, and beliefs are created through experience. As members of your organization have experiences that reinforce, reward, and exemplify core values, they will form and maintain beliefs about the organization and its values that encourage value-centered behavior.\nThis is why the creation of value-centered experiences must be conscious and intentional. In addition to folding your core values into their own daily actions, leaders will do well to go out of their way to create experiences that reinforce core values.\n#9 Eliminate Experiences that Don’t Support Your Core Values\nThis discussion about creating experiences is especially important if you have noticed a trend in company culture that is concerning. When employee behaviors and attitudes are not reflecting the culture and values you envision, it means that, somewhere along the line, they have had experiences that created beliefs that motivated those behaviors.\nFor example, if an employee’s experience is that they receive bonuses for shipping more product, their belief is that it is the quantity of product they ship that is most highly valued. A resulting behavior might be that quality is sacrificed in order to ship product quickly.\nRooting out such experiences is best done explicitly, in continuing conversations with organization members. Your staff meetings and chat channels can be avenues for collecting data about team members’ experiences and beliefs about the way things are done or the way things ought to be done.\n#10 Use Your Core Values as a Guidepost During the Decision-Making Process\nRemember that core values, by nature, are definitional. You are not you, and your organization is not your organization, without these values. They are non-negotiable, and they run even deeper than your bottom line.\nWhen making decisions as a leader, allow your core values to guide you. At times, it might mean sacrificing other things in favor of aligning with your values. However, this will communicate your core values and prompt positive cultural shift in powerful ways that ultimately drive success.\n#11 Use Core Values as Your Decision-Making Framework\nIt doesn’t stop there. Not only should your values be an integral part of your decision-making process; they should also factor into the way you communicate those decisions. As you announce or discuss decisions with members of your organization, refer back to the values that influenced those decisions. This will help employees see how you use core values to make decisions and guide your own behavior. As a leader, they will refer to and live up to the example you set.",

    "content": "Can you believe it’s already October? We can’t either. Now is the time you should be developing or refreshing your 2025 strategy!\nGood Strategy Helps Retain Your Top Talent\nWe’re not talking about the standard, boring approach to strategic planning. We’re actually talking about having a lightweight, agile plan that gives your organization direction with an agile implementation approach to keep your team focused and engaged. We also like to emphasize the agile implementation piece of any planning process.\nGood strategy lends itself to good leadership, organization-wide engagement, and focus–the earmark of high-functioning teams. And truth-be-told, everyone could use a little more of that right now.\nGet the Free Guide for Agile Implementation & OKR Cycles\nSo, to help kick off this planning season, we’ve pulled together this tip sheet with 12 pro tips to reference as you develop your 2025 plan. We don’t recommend you use all 12; pick three that you think fit best with your organization’s need and culture.\nFocus Area #1 – Build a Clear, Meaningful Plan\nThe foundation of any successful planning cycle is a great plan. This isn’t as easy as it sounds, but here are a few valuable tips you can consider using as you start developing your 2025 plan:\nDon’t call it strategic planning.\nListen, strategic planning as you’ve pictured it or always done it is dead, especially in the age of hybrid work and the fatigue many organizations face today. Ditch the label. Call it something different, such as growth planning or future planning. Give it a fresh life with a new name but stay true to the core components of what makes a strategic plan actually strategic.\nMake your outcomes crystal clear.\nIf you make your outcomes crystal clear, your team can better understand where you’re going and how they support those outcomes. Keeping your talent connected to your desired outcomes helps create more engaged, focus teams.\nChart your own course.\nWe see organizations try to copy a competitor’s strategy or try to copy a strategy from an organization in a different industry. But, why don’t you lean on your talent and leadership team to chart your own course for success? Take your team’s input and build a unique approach to achieve your desired future state. Hint — your team is more likely to stick around if they get to implement something they built.\nIf you don’t have an envisioned future, don’t plan.\nListen, we’ll never advocate for not having a strategy in place. But we will always advocate for having a clear vision or future state to work towards. If you don’t have a clear vision, check out our video and canvas on how to create one. Having a clear vision is important to keep your team engaged and focused on achieving a future state. Working towards something big and impactful is more valuable than just working to work.\nSeparate the process from the plan.\nThe flow of a process doesn’t need to follow the outline of the strategic plan deliverables. You may choose to do things out of order, or start in one place and go to another. The process can be non-linear. A strategic planning document is linear, and you don’t need to create a plan in the perfect order.\nDon’t debate semantics.\nNo one has the time or energy to endlessly debate the wording of your vision, goals, and objectives. Get it directionally there, and then let your leadership team or a copywriter pull it together.\nFocus Area #2 – Connect Your People to the Plan\nPlans don’t execute themselves; execution requires your people knowing what they’re doing, why they’re doing it, and how it helps accomplish your long-term vision of success. Here are few valuable tips that make connecting your people to your plan just a bit easier:\nOKRs do work with the right culture.\nSpend time building the future.\nWe see organizations struggle all the time during strategy reviews and planning by focusing too much on the past. We follow the rule of 80/20. Twenty percent of your time is spent reviewing performance and learnings, 80% of your time is spent creating the future. People get really excited when they get to help build the future, and your organization benefits from always moving forward.\nData matters. But it doesn’t need to be perfect.\nData is important in any business. But don’t overstress about having every point, decimal, or line absolutely perfect. Get it directionally correct and use it! Overwhelming your team with administrative data collection and analysis may not add value to your business. Plus, it’s just too stressful to try to make it perfect.\nFocus Area #3 – Keep Everyone Engaged & Focused\nStaying focused on what matters most requires a consistent, dedicated process and a culture that supports agile strategy. Easier said than done, but here are a few really helpful tips to consider as you build your plan for the new year:\nKeep work fresh with quarterly refreshes.\nWe’re huge advocates of using quarterly refreshes to keep your plan fresh and your team engaged. Having quarterly refreshes allows you to see performance, create new focus for the coming quarter, and gives your team a voice in what they’ll accomplish to support your vision and quarterly direction.\nNeed a guide to help establish a quarterly rhythm? Check out the StrategySprintTM Guide here.\nBuild a plan that matches your implementation.\nAs you set up your plan, make sure its structure and reporting match how you’ll implement it. If you review weekly, make sure that your plan is set up to report weekly. If you refresh quarterly, make sure you have key results or goals that are quarterly. You’ll lose engagement and create frustration if your plan doesn’t match how you want to keep it in focus.\nOne-page plans are magic.\nWe love one-page strategic plans. They communicate your vision and direction and what you need to accomplish in a single view. It’s a tool we use all the time to keep our client teams engaged in what matters most in achieving the organization’s vision of success.\nWant a One-Page Plan template?

    "content": "Article Synopsis\nMost consultants treat referrals like a lottery ticket, hoping clients will remember to send business their way. Or that asking for referrals once is enough. But the reality is, successful consultants build systematic referral processes that generate consistent, high-quality opportunities.\nThis guide reveals the proven 4-step system used by our most successful clients: define your problem and solution clearly, reactivate your existing network with personalized outreach, ask for referrals using specific scripts that work, and track everything systematically. Add strategic networking and AI-enhanced tools to amplify your efforts, and you’ll transform referrals from random luck into predictable revenue. The consultants who escape feast-or-famine cycles don’t just get more referrals — they design referral systems that work whether they’re actively pursuing them or not.\nYou’re tired of the feast-or-famine cycle. It’s the most stressful part of being a consultant. One month you’re overwhelmed with client work, the next you’re scrambling to find your next project. Sound familiar?\nMost consultants get trapped in this endless loop because they treat referrals like a lottery ticket — hoping someone will remember to send business their way instead of building a systematic approach that generates qualified leads consistently.\nHere’s what I’ve learned after working with over 1,000 consultants: referrals aren’t something that just happen to you. They’re something you create through deliberate strategy and systematic execution.\nThe consultants who escape the feast-or-famine cycle don’t just get more referrals — they build referral systems that work whether they’re actively pursuing them or not. And in 2025, the smart ones are using AI to amplify every aspect of this process.\nTable of Contents\nWhy Most Referral Strategies Fail\nBefore we dive into what works, let’s address why most consultants struggle with referrals. The biggest mistake? Treating referrals as an afterthought.\nFor example, you finish a project, send a thank-you note, and hope the client remembers you when they meet someone who needs your services. That’s not a strategy. That’s wishful thinking.\nThe second mistake is asking for referrals the wrong way. Most consultants say something like, “If you know anyone who could use my services, please let me know.” This vague request puts the burden on your contact to figure out who might need your help and how to describe what you do.\nThe third mistake is inconsistency. You ask for referrals when you’re desperate for work, then forget about it when you’re busy. Referral generation needs to be a consistent part of your business development process, not something you do only when the pipeline runs dry.\nThe Consulting Success® 4-Step Referral System\nBased on our Client Acquisition Playbook, here’s the proven system that works:\nStep 1: Define Your Problem and Solution\nBefore anyone can refer you effectively, you need crystal-clear messaging about who you help and how you help them.\nStart with the one big problem your ideal clients face. Not five problems, not ten, but one specific, pressing issue that keeps them up at night.\nThen define your solution in simple terms. Whether it’s a custom dashboard for inventory management, a leadership development program, or a cybersecurity audit, you need to articulate it in a way that’s easy for your referral sources to understand and explain to others. For example:\n“I help fast-growing CPG companies create custom dashboards that help them make better decisions faster for their inventory, SKU, and promotion management. This helps them scale more effectively and profitably.”\nNotice how specific that is? Your referral sources can easily identify who might need this and explain what you do. You’re making it easier for them to do so.\nStep 2: Network Reactivation\nThis is where most consultants have untapped potential sitting right in front of them. For many consultants, it’s a goldmine waiting to be tapped.\nMake a list of at least 30 people who could be potential ideal clients or referral sources. These are people you already have a relationship with — former colleagues, past clients, industry contacts, even friends who work in your target market.\nThe key is the personal touch. Don’t send a mass email. Each message should include something personal that shows you remember your relationship. To help you, here’s a script that works:\n“Hi Sarah, how are you? Hope you and your family are well. I can’t believe it’s been almost a year since we met at the Denver conference. I wanted to let you know I’m now focused on working with fast-growing CPG companies and creating custom dashboards that help them make better decisions faster for their inventory and promotion management. This helps them scale more effectively and profitably. Is this something that would be valuable for your company or someone you know?”\nStep 3: Ask for Referrals Systematically\nReferral marketing is not something you casually do. In fact, here’s where most consultants get nervous, but it’s actually the easiest part when you do it right.\nSchedule calls with past and current clients. Tell them you want to catch up and have a question you’d like their feedback on. This takes the pressure off and frames it as seeking advice rather than asking for a favor. Here’s a sample script to follow:\n“Jennifer, I really enjoyed working with you on the inventory optimization project because we were able to reduce your carrying costs by 23% while improving availability. Do you know any other mid-market CPG companies in your network that could benefit from the type of work we do? We’re always open to introductions to great people like yourself, and I’m wondering if there are 2-3 people that come to mind?”\nIf they say yes, you can say: “That’s great, could you send a quick email to connect us? I would really appreciate that.” If they seem to hesitate, you can also add: “If you want, I can write it for you and you can customize it.”\nThe beauty of this approach is that you’re not asking them to sell for you. You’re simply asking for an introduction, which feels much easier for them to provide.\nStep 4: Track Everything\nAs the saying goes, you can’t improve what you don’t measure. So use a simple tracking system to monitor your referral activities. It can be a simple spreadsheet or you can use a consulting CRM software. You want to track:\n- Name and contact information\n- Date contacted\n- Channel used (email, phone, text)\n- Response and next steps\n- Follow-up dates\nIf someone says they’ll send an introduction but doesn’t follow through within a week, use this gentle reminder:\n“Hi Mark, it was great speaking with you the other day. So nice to hear about the new product launch. I’m looking forward to connecting with Jennifer. I’d really appreciate it if you could make that introduction in the next day or two if possible? Thank you!”\nAnd as mentioned earlier, you can offer to write it for them and suggest that they can customize the message to make things easier for them.\nMake a habit of sending a simple follow-up message to all of your past clients every few months.\nAI-Enhanced Referral Marketing\nHere’s where things gets interesting. In today’s AI-driven world, smart consultants are using artificial intelligence to amplify every aspect of their referral strategy, making the entire process more efficient and effective.\nAI for Research and Prospect Identification\nInstead of guessing who might be a good referral source, use AI to analyze your network systematically. Upload your LinkedIn connections to AI tools and ask them to identify potential referral sources based on industry, company size, and role.\nYou can also use AI to research your existing contacts before reaching out, gathering recent company news, personal updates, or industry developments that you can reference in your outreach. Here’s a sample prompt:\n“Act as an expert referral marketing analyst and strategist. Analyze these LinkedIn connections and identify the top 20 people most likely to know mid-market CPG companies that would need inventory management consulting. Consider their industry, role, company size, and connection patterns.”\nAI for Personalized Outreach\nOnce you’ve identified your potential targets, AI can help you craft personalized messages that feel genuine and relevant. Provide AI with the basic framework of your message, information about your relationship with the contact, and any recent updates about their company or industry.\nThe AI can help you weave these elements together naturally. Here’s a prompt:\n“Help me write a personalized referral request email to Sarah, who I met at a conference last year. She’s a VP of Operations at a mid-size consumer goods company. Her company just announced expansion into three new markets. I want to ask if she knows other CPG companies who might need inventory management consulting.”\nAI for Follow-Up Sequences\nThe fortune is in the follow-up, but most consultants drop the ball because they don’t have systems in place. AI can help you create and manage follow-up sequences that feel personal while being systematically consistent.\nSet up AI-assisted reminders and draft follow-up messages based on the type of response (or lack thereof) you received. This ensures no opportunity falls through the cracks. AI agents can help automate much of this process.\nAI for Referral Tracking and Analysis\nUse AI to analyze patterns in your referral activities. Which types of contacts are most likely to provide referrals? What messaging approaches get the best response rates? Which follow-up timing works best?\nAI can help you identify these patterns and optimize your approach over time, turning referral generation from an art into a science.\nAdvanced Referral Strategies\nThe Reverse Referral Approach\nInstead of just asking for referrals, start by giving them. When you refer business to others in your network, you create reciprocity and strengthen relationships.\nKeep a list of trusted service providers in complementary areas — legal, accounting, marketing, technology — and actively look for opportunities to make introductions. This positions you as a connector and makes others more likely to think of you when they encounter someone who needs your services.\nThe Value-First Referral System\nBefore asking for referrals, provide value to your potential referral sources. Share relevant industry insights, introduce them to useful contacts, or offer brief consultations on challenges they’re facing.\nThis approach works particularly well with centers of influence — people like lawyers, accountants, and other consultants who regularly interact with your ideal clients but don’t compete with your services.\nThe Collaboration Strategy\nPartner with complementary consultants and service providers targeting the same audience you are to create formal referral relationships. If you specialize in operations consulting, for example, then partner with strategy consultants, technology consultants, or HR consultants who work with similar clients.\nEstablish clear guidelines about when and how to refer, fee-sharing arrangements if appropriate, and communication protocols to ensure smooth handoffs.\nStrategic Networking: Event-Based Referral Marketing\nWhile systematic referral requests form the backbone of your strategy, strategic networking at events and gatherings amplifies your efforts exponentially. But here’s the thing — most consultants approach networking completely wrong.\nThey show up to events with a stack of business cards, pitch everyone they meet about their services, and wonder why nothing meaningful comes from it. That’s not networking; that’s interruption marketing with a name tag.\nThe Right Way to Network for Referrals\nEffective networking isn’t about selling your consulting services. It’s about building relationships that lead to referral opportunities. Your goal at any networking event should be to identify potential referral sources, not immediate clients.\nBefore the Event: Research who’s attending. Most business events publish attendee lists or have LinkedIn groups where you can see participants. Identify 5-10 people you’d like to meet — not because they need your services, but because they work with your ideal clients.\nDuring the Event: Focus on being genuinely curious about others’ businesses and challenges. Ask questions like “What trends are you seeing in your industry?” or “What’s the biggest challenge your clients are facing right now?” Listen for problems your ideal clients face, but resist the urge to pitch immediately.\nThe Follow-Up Framework: This is where most consultants drop the ball. Within 48 hours, send a personalized message that references your conversation and offers value. Don’t ask for anything — just provide a useful resource, relevant article, or introduction to someone who could help them.\nFinding the Right Events\nNot all networking events are created equal. The key is finding specific gatherings where your ideal referral sources congregate, i.e., other businesses that target or work with your ideal clients, and not necessarily where your ideal clients attend.\nIf you help manufacturing companies with operational efficiency, don’t just attend manufacturing conferences. Look for events where business lawyers, accountants, IT consultants, and other professionals who serve manufacturers gather. These are the people who regularly encounter companies that might need your expertise.\nLocal Business Events: Chamber of Commerce meetings, Rotary Club gatherings, and industry meetups often provide more intimate settings for building meaningful relationships than large conferences.\nIndustry Conferences: While your clients attend these events, focus on connecting with other service providers in complementary fields. The consultant who does strategy work might refer operational projects to you, and vice versa.\nProfessional Associations: Join professional and business associations for expert advisors, consultants, or specific industries where you can build relationships with peers who serve similar client bases.\nCasual Networking: The Hidden Opportunity\nSome of the best referral sources emerge from casual encounters — the person sitting next to you on a flight, the parent you meet at your kid’s soccer game, or the neighbor you chat with while walking your dog.\nThe secret is having a simple, conversational way to describe what you do that invites follow-up questions without sounding like a sales pitch. Instead of saying “I’m a business consultant,” try something like “I help companies figure out why their inventory systems aren’t working the way they should.”\nThis specificity makes it easier for people to remember you and think of you when they encounter someone with that exact problem.\nThe Coffee Connection Strategy: When you meet someone interesting at a casual event, suggest meeting for coffee to learn more about their business. This low-pressure follow-up often leads to the most valuable referral relationships because it’s built on genuine connection rather than transactional networking.\nTurning Referrals Into Revenue\nGetting referrals is only half the battle. The other half is converting those warm introductions into paying clients. Doing so is a process you shouldn’t ignore.\nThe Introduction Response Framework\nWhen someone provides an introduction, respond within 24 hours with a message that thanks the referrer, provides value to the prospect immediately, and suggests a specific next step. Here’s an example script:\n“Hi Tom, thanks so much for connecting us. Jennifer mentioned you’re expanding into new markets — that’s exciting! I’ve helped several CPG companies navigate similar expansions, particularly around inventory management challenges that come with multi-location operations. Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call this week to discuss how companies typically handle this transition?”\nThe Referral Follow-Up System\nDon’t just follow up with the prospect. Stay in touch with the person who made the referral. Let them know how the conversation went and thank them regardless of the outcome. They’ll appreciate it and feel that you value their support.\nThis feedback loop encourages them to make future referrals because they see the value of their connections and feel appreciated for their efforts.\n“The best referral sources are those who see the positive outcomes of their introductions. Always close the loop and show appreciation, whether the referral converts or not.”\nMeasuring Referral Success\nTrack these key metrics to optimize your referral system:\nActivity Metrics:\n- Number of referral requests made per month\n- Response rate to referral requests\n- Number of introductions received\n- Follow-up consistency rate\nOutcome Metrics:\n- Referral-to-conversation conversion rate\n- Referral-to-proposal conversion rate\n- Referral-to-client conversion rate\n- Average project value from referrals vs. other sources\nRelationship Metrics:\n- Number of active referral sources\n- Frequency of referral source communication\n- Reciprocal referrals provided\nUse these metrics to identify what’s working and where you need to adjust your approach. You can also combine this process with your referral tracking method.\nCommon Referral Mistakes to Avoid\nThe Spray and Pray Approach\nSending the same generic referral request to everyone in your network is a waste of time and damages relationships. Each request should be personalized based on your relationship with that person and their specific network.\nThe One-and-Done Mistake\nAsking for referrals once and then never following up is leaving money on the table. The best referral sources need regular nurturing and multiple touchpoints to stay engaged. It’s also a great opportunity to update your referral sources with any key information that might be useful to them in referring others to you.\nThe Weak Ask\n“Let me know if you think of anyone” is not a referral request. It’s a hope. Be specific about who you’re looking for and what problems you solve for them.\nThe Pressure Play\nMaking people feel obligated to provide referrals will backfire. Frame referral requests as opportunities to help others solve problems, not as favors owed to you.\nBuilding Your Referral Culture\nThe most successful consultants don’t just have referral strategies. They build referral cultures around their businesses.\nThis means making referrals a natural part of every client relationship from the beginning. During your initial discovery calls, ask clients about their network and the challenges other companies in their industry face.\nThroughout your engagement, stay alert for opportunities to provide additional value through introductions and connections. When you position yourself as a valuable connector, clients naturally think of you when they encounter others who need your expertise.\nYour Next Steps in Building a Predictable Pipeline\nReferral marketing isn’t magic. It’s methodology. The consultants who consistently generate high-quality referrals follow systematic processes, nurture relationships deliberately, and leverage modern tools to amplify their efforts.\nStart with the four-step system outlined above. Pick 30 people from your existing network, craft personalized messages using the templates provided, and commit to making referral generation a regular part of your business development activities.\nRemember, the goal isn’t just to get more referrals. It’s to build a systematized referral process that works consistently, whether you’re actively pursuing opportunities or focused on client delivery.\nThe difference between consultants who struggle and those who thrive often comes down to this: they stop surviving their business and start designing it. Referral marketing is one of the most powerful ways to design a consulting business that works for you instead of against you.\nReady to build a referral system that delivers consistent, high-quality opportunities? Our Clarity Coaching™ program provides the done-with-you support and proven frameworks to help consultants like you implement these strategies successfully.\nYou’ll work alongside experienced coaches and join a community of consultants who are building thriving, referral-driven practices. Because confidence comes from clarity, and clarity comes from having the right system and support to make it work.\nFAQ About This Article\nHow many people should I reach out to when starting a referral campaign?\nStart by making a list of at least 30 people who could be potential ideal clients or referral sources from your existing network. These should be people you already have a relationship with — former colleagues, past clients, industry contacts, or friends who work in your target market. Focus on quality over quantity and ensure each outreach message is personalized rather than sending generic mass emails.\nWhat’s the best way to ask for referrals without sounding pushy or desperate?\nFrame your referral request as seeking advice rather than asking for a favor. Schedule a call to “catch up and get their feedback on something.” Then use this script: “I really enjoyed working with you on [specific project] because [specific result]. Do you know any other [description of ideal client] in your network that could benefit from the type of work we do? I’m wondering if there are 2-3 people that come to mind?” This approach focuses on introductions, not asking them to sell for you.\nHow often should I follow up on referral requests?\nIf someone promises to send an introduction but doesn’t follow through within a week, send one gentle reminder. For general referral relationship maintenance, reach out to your referral sources every few months with valuable updates, industry insights, or simply to check in. Consistency is key — make referral generation a regular part of your business development process, not something you only do when desperate for work.\nShould I focus on networking events where my ideal clients attend?\nFocus primarily on events where your ideal referral sources congregate — other professionals who serve your target market but don’t compete with you. If you help manufacturing companies, attend events with business lawyers, accountants, IT consultants, and other service providers who work with manufacturers. These professionals regularly encounter companies that might need your expertise and can make warm introductions.\nHow can AI tools help with my referral marketing efforts?\nAI can amplify your referral strategy in four key ways: analyzing your LinkedIn network to identify the best potential referral sources, crafting personalized outreach messages that reference recent company news or industry developments, managing follow-up sequences to ensure no opportunities fall through the cracks, and analyzing patterns in your referral activities to optimize your approach over time.\nWhat metrics should I track to measure my referral success?\nTrack three categories of metrics: Activity metrics (number of referral requests made monthly, response rates, introductions received), Outcome metrics (referral-to-conversation conversion rate, referral-to-proposal rate, referral-to-client rate, average project value), and Relationship metrics (number of active referral sources, communication frequency, reciprocal referrals provided). Use these to identify what’s working and adjust your approach accordingly.\nLearn More About Clarity Coaching™\nWe transform consultants into confident consulting business owners.\nYour Clarity Coaching™ Application Call is Free →",

    "content": "The key to any successful startup is close collaboration between product\nand engineering. This sounds easy, but can be incredibly difficult. Both\ngroups may have conflicting goals and different definitions of success that\nhave to be reconciled. Engineering might want to build a product that is\nperfectly scalable for the future with the best developer experience.\nProduct might want to quickly validate their ideas, and put features out\nthat will entice customers to pay for the product. Another example that’s\ncommon to see is an engineering-led âengineering roadmapâ and a product-led\nâproduct roadmapâ and for the two to be completely independent of each\nother, leading to confusion for product engineering. These two mindsets\nput two parts of your organization at odds. The easy path is to skip the\ndifficult conversations and operate within silos, coming together\ninfrequently to deliver a release. We believe that aligning these two\ndisparate organizations into cohesive team units removes organizational\nfriction and improves time to value.\nHow did you get into the bottleneck?\nAt the beginning of a startup’s journey, aligning is natural because\nyou are a small team working closely together, and likely the product and\ntech leaders had close personal relationships before the company was\nfounded. The initial startup idea is very strong and as it quickly gains\ntraction, what to work on next is obvious to all groups. As the company\ngrows, however, skill-based verticals begin to appear with more layers of\nmanagement, and these managers don’t always put the effort in to create\nan effective working relationship with their peers. Instead, they focus on\nurgent tasks, like keeping the application running or preparing for a\nfunding round. At the same time, the startup faces a critical juncture where the company needs to\nto decide how to best invest in the product, and needs a holistic\nstrategy for doing so.\nWell-run startups are already working in cross-functional product\nteams. Some functions will naturally work well together because they fall\nunder the same vertical hierarchy. An example would be development and\ntesting — well integrated in startups, but often siloed in traditional\nenterprise IT. However, in the scaleups we work with, we find that product\nand technical teams are quite separated. This happens when employees align\nmore with their function in an Activity Oriented\norganization rather than with an Outcome Oriented team, and it\nhappens at every level: Product managers are not aligned with tech leads\nand engineering managers; directors not aligned with directors; VPs not\naligned with VPs; CTOs not aligned with CPOs.\nUltimately, the bottleneck will be felt by reduced organizational\nperformance as it chokes the creation of customer and business value.\nStartups will see it manifest in organizational tension, disruptive\nexceptions, unchecked technical debt, and velocity loss. Fortunately,\nthere are some key signs to look for that indicate friction between your\nproduct and engineering organizations. In this article we will describe\nthese signs, as well as solutions to lower the communication barriers,\nbuild a balanced investment portfolio, maximize return on investment, and\nminimize risk over the long term.\nSigns you are approaching a scaling bottleneck\nFinger pointing across functions\nTeam members align themselves with their management structure or\nfunctional leadership as their primary identity, instead of their\nbusiness or customer value stream, making it easier for teams to assume\nan “us” versus “them” posture.\nAt its worst the “us vs them” posture can become truly toxic, with little respect for each other. We have seen this manifest when product leaders throw requirements over the wall, and treat the engineering team as a feature factory. They might abruptly cancel projects when the project doesn’t hit its outcomes, without any prior indication the project wasn’t meeting its KPIs. Or conversely, the engineering team continually lets down the product team by missing delivery dates, without warning that this might happen. The end outcome is both sides losing trust in each other.\nEngineers often stuck due to lack of product context\nWhen product managers pass off features and requirements without reviewing them with the\nengineers (usually within the constructs of a tool like Jira), critical business and customer context can be lost. If\nengineers operate without context, then when design or\ndevelopment decisions need to be made, they must pause and track down the product\nmanager, rather than make informed decisions themselves. Or worse, they made the decision anyway and\nbuild software based on an incorrect understanding of the product\nvision, causing time delays or unused software. This friction disrupts\nflow and introduces undue waste in your delivery value stream.\nMissed dependencies\nWhen engineers and architects operate with minimal context, the full\nscope of a change can be overlooked or misunderstood. Requirements or\nuser stories lack depth without context. Customer personas can be\nignored, business rules not taken into consideration, technical\nintegration points or cross-functional requirements missed. This\noften leads to last minute additions or unintended disruptions to the\nbusiness or customer experience.\nWork slipping between the cracks\nTasks slipping between the cracks, team members thinking someone else\nwill be responsible for an activity, team members nudging each other out\nof the way because they think the other team member is operating in\ntheir space, or worse, team members saying “that’s not my job” – these\nare all signs of unclear roles and responsibilities, poor communication\nand collaboration, and friction.\nTechnical debt negotiation breakdown\nTechnical debt is a common byproduct of modern software development\nwith many root causes that we have\ndiscussed previously. When product and engineering organizations\naren’t communicating or collaborating effectively during product\nplanning, we tend to see an imbalanced investment mix. This can mean the\nproduct backlog leans more heavily towards new feature development and\nnot enough attention is directed toward paying down technical debt.\nExamples include:\n- Higher frequency of incidents and higher production support costs\n- Developer burnout through trying to churn out features while working\naround friction\n- An extensive feature list of low quality features that customers quickly\nabandon\nTeams communicating but not collaborating\nTeams that meet regularly to discuss their work are communicating.\nTeams that openly seek and provide input while actively working are\ncollaborating. Having regular status meetings where teams give updates\non different components doesn’t mean a team is collaborative.\nCollaboration happens when teams actively try to understand each other\nand openly seek and provide input while working.\nHow do you get out of the bottleneck?\nEliminating the wall between Product and Engineering is essential to\nestablishing high performing product teams. Cross-functional teams must\ncommunicate and collaborate effectively and they must be able to negotiate\namongst themselves on how best to reach their goals. These are strategies\nThoughtworks has applied to overcome this bottleneck when working with our\nscaleup clients.\nIdentify and reinforce your “First Team”\nAt its most basic, a product team is a group of individuals who come\ntogether in a joint action around a common goal to create business and\ncustomer value. Each team contributes to that value creation in their own\nunique way or with their unique scope. As leaders, it’s important to identify\nand reinforce a team dynamic around the creation of value rather than an\norganizational reporting structure. This cross-functional product team becomes\na team member’s “first team”. As a leader, when you define your team as your\ngroup of direct reports, you are enabling a tribal concept that contributes to\nan “us vs. them” dynamic.\nThe First Team mindset was defined by\nPatrick Lencioni and referenced in many of his works including\nThe Advantage and The Five Dysfunctions Of A Team: A Leadership\nFable, and while it’s typically used in relation with the\nestablishment of cross-functional leadership teams as the primary\naccountability team rather than organizational reports, the same concept\nis applicable here for product teams.\nSimply changing your organization's language, without changing its\nbehaviors isn’t going to have a measurable impact on your scaling woes. Still,\nit's a simple place to start and it addresses the organizational friction and\nlarger cultural issues that lie at the root of your performance issues.\nChanging the language\nThe more hands-on an organization is willing to be in breaking\nsilos, the more likely it is they will be effectively be breaking some\nof the implicit ‘versus’ states that have enabled them.\n-- Duena Blomstrom\nTaking a hands-on approach to moderating the language\nused in your organization is a simple first step to breaking down\nbarriers and reducing friction.\n- Referring to your organizational group of practitioners as anything other\nthan “team” – such as squad, pod, or whatever term fits your organization’s\nculture is a small change that can have a strong impact.\n- Naming your cross-functional product delivery teams,\nideally with the name of their product or value stream, is another simple change that helps\nthese multi-disciplined individuals adopt a new team identity separate from\ntheir organizational reporting context.\n- Drop “us” and “them” from the professional vocabulary. Coming up with\nalternative terms but keeping the same context of ‘that group over there - which\nisn’t this group’ is cheating. We filter ourselves and our language in a\nprofessional environment regularly and this language needs to be added to the\n‘not allowed’ list.\nChange the behavior\nThose of us trying to\nchange our organizations’ culture need to define the things we want to\ndo, the ways we want to behave and want each other to behave, to provide\ntraining and then to do what is necessary to reinforce those behaviors.\nThe culture will change as a result.\n-- John Shook\nChanging an organization’s culture when it isn’t delivering the desired\nresults is hard. Many books have been written on the subject. By\ndefining and communicating the expected behaviors of your teams and\ntheir respective team members up front, you set the underlying tone for\nthe culture you are striving to create.\n- Leaders should set a principle and expectation of a blameless culture. When\nsomething goes wrong, it’s a wonderful learning opportunity, to be studied and\nused to continuously improve. An example of this is the concept of\na blameless post-mortem.\n- Set expectations and regularly inspect adoption of desired behaviors. Hold\nteam members accountable to these behaviors and refuse to tolerate\nexceptions.\n- Orient “team” constructs around value streams instead of functions.\nDifferentiate “teams” as groups who deliver common value from Communities of\nPractices or Centers of Excellence which are typically formed to deepen or\ndeliver specific competencies such as Product Management or Quality\nAssurance.\n- Acknowledge that some personality types are less compatible than others.\nShift talented people around to find the optimal team synergy.\nDefine and communicate how your scaleup delivers value\nA company is, in many ways, just one large team with one shared goal\n— the success of the organization. When product and engineering don’t\nhave a shared understanding of that goal, it’s hard for them to come to\na collaborative agreement on how to achieve it. To avoid this source of\nfriction, executives must clearly articulate and disseminate the overall\nvalue their organization provides to its customers, investors, and\nsociety. Leaders are responsible for describing how each product and\nservice in your portfolio contributes to delivering that value.\nManagement must ensure that every team member understands how the work\nthat they do day in and day out creates value to the organization and\nits customers.\nThe goal is to create a shared mental model of how the business\ncreates value. The best way to do this is highly dependent on the nature\nof your business. We have found certain kinds of assets to be both\ncommon and useful across our scaleup clients:\nAssets that describe customer and user value\nThese should describe the value your product and services create, who\nthey create it for, and the ways you measure that value. Examples\ninclude:\n- Business Model Canvas/Lean Canvas\n- User Journeys\n- Service blueprints\n- Personas\n- Empathy maps\n- Storyboards\n- Job forces diagrams\n- Product overviews (one-pagers, etc)\nAssets that describe your economic model\nThese should describe the value your company receives from customers,\nthe cost of creating that value, and the ways in which you measure that\nvalue. Examples include:\n- Business flywheels\n- Value stream maps\n- Wardley maps\n- Retention/churn models\n- Customer acquisition models\n- Customer lifetime value models\n- Projected balance sheets and income\nstatements\nAssets that describe your strategy\nThese should describe why you’ve chosen to serve these customers in\nthis way, the evidence you used to make that decision, and the highest\nleverage ways you can increase the value you create and the value you\nreceive in return.\n- Target customer profiles\n- Issue trees\n- Impact maps\n- Opportunity/solution trees\n- Hierarchy diagrams\n- Causal loop diagrams\n- Other bespoke frameworks and models\nOnce you have these assets, it’s important to constantly refer to\nthem in presentations, in meetings, when making decsions, and most importantly,\nwhen there is conflict. Communicate when you change them,\nand what made you make those changes. Solicit updates from the\norganization. In short, make them part of your normal operations and\ndon’t let them become wallpaper or another cubicle pinup.\nA simple heuristic that we’ve found to understand how successful\nyou’ve been in this communication is to pick a random individual\ncontributor and ask them to answer the questions answered by these\nassets. The better they can do this without referring to the assets, the\nbetter they will be at incorporating this thinking into their work. If\nthey don’t even know that the assets exist, then you still have a good\ndeal of work to do.\nThe alignment and focus these assets create allow for better\ndeployment of organizational resources, which enables scaling.\nAdditionally, they redirect the natural tension between product and\nengineering. Instead of unproductive interpersonal friction, you can use\ncreating and updating these assets as a venue for true collaboration and\nhealthy disagreement about ideas that strengthen the company.\nCreate multidisciplinary stream-aligned teams\nWhen a company is just starting out, it often only has one value\nstream. But once it grows, it needs to break apart its products and\nservices into multiple value streams so that individual teams can\nassume full ownership of various products or pieces of products. The\nbest way to do this decomposition is beyond the scope of this article\n(we personally are big fans of Team Topologies as a way to think\nthrough it), but some key things to consider are:\n- Could this value stream and the products and services it comprises exist as\na separate company (even if it wouldn’t be a highly successful one)?\n- Can you align your value streams to a specific way that your company creates\nvalue, or to a specific customer or user that the company creates value\nfor?\n- How do your different value streams interact with each other?\nAfter defining your value streams, it’s time to bring\nmulti-disciplined team members together around them — because value creation is a team sport. Ask the leaders\nof these value streams to create similar but more detailed versions of\nthe assets we discussed above, and then determine what skills and\ncapabilities are routinely needed to deliver and evolve the value of\nthe product(s) and/or service(s) in the value streams from start to\nfinish.\nPool those individuals together into an Outcome Oriented team, rather\nthan coordinating work across Activity Oriented or functional teams. In\nAgile IT Organization Design, Sriram Narayam\nstates, “The more process and indirection there is, the greater the\nfriction for effective collaboration. By contrast, people within a team\ndon’t have to schedule meetings to collaborate with each other. They\ncollaborate continuously and get into huddles (informal, ad hoc\nmeetings—virtual or face to face) on demand.” While this model helps\nreduce latency within outcome-oriented team, it also reduces the\nfriction among multidisciplinary team members.\nKeep in mind that as your company grows, you may need to have\n“teams of teams”, with multiple teams aligned around one value stream\nand a team of cross-functional leaders for that value stream as well.\nAs the complexity of your value creation increases, so too does the\ncriticality of maintaining common purpose across your product delivery\nteams.\nProduct managers and software engineers have a shared\nresponsibility to understand the needs of the customer so that they\ncan define and prioritize the work. There isn’t an ideal mix of\nproduct people to engineers; every product is going to have a\ndifferent ratio. The important part is to know that both are\nresponsible for understanding, prioritizing and creating value.\nAs the product evolves, the needs of the team will evolve as well.\nTake regular inventory of the team's capabilities and empower the\nstream-aligned teams to advocate for their own needs. Ensure that the\nteams are fully resourced with the staff, skills, information, and\nauthority to deliver efficiently without unnecessary dependencies on\nexternal resources. Fully sourced, empowered and autonomous product\nteams operating as a single entity, regardless of each individual’s\nreporting structure, dramatically reducing cross-discipline\nfriction.\nEstablish team working agreements at all levels\nEnsure every team member knows what role they’re playing\nThe best teams are those that have negotiated the best ways of working for\nthemselves. It’s important for organizations to have established sensible\ndefaults to guide less mature teams on how to work effectively as a team. Even\nwith established defaults, it's important that teams have autonomy to decide\nwhich member will take on which responsibilities. This measure of autonomy\nleads to greater accountability and a higher level of intrinsic motivation. As\nnew teams form, codify this working agreement in the team's common knowledge\nrepository. During retrospectives, revisit this team working agreement as the\nteam learns more about each team member’s strengths and weaknesses and\nreassign the responsibilities accordingly. This team working agreement becomes\nboth the social contract of the team, and also a unique âresponsibility\nfingerprintâ that no other team has. As new team members join or rotate\nthrough the team, having a referenceable team working agreement accelerates\nintegration and reduces time to value during onboarding.\nTeam working agreements frequently contain:\n- Team Name: What is the unique identifier for the team?\n- Team Mission: Why does this specific team exist? What value is it expected\nto deliver?\n- Team Metrics: How will the team measure success? Include value creation\nmetrics, not just activity metrics.\n- Team Responsibilities: What work needs to be done to ensure success and\nwhich team members are agreeing to own those work items? Organizations can seed\nthis work with typical activities and recommendations for team responsibility\nallocations, but team members are free to renegotiate amongst themselves.\n- Team Skills: What skills are needed on this particular team to ensure\nsuccess?\n- Team Norms: Guidelines, principles, ceremonies, and/or sensible defaults for\nteam members to align on how team members are expected to behave, interact, and\nmake decisions.\nNegotiate a balanced product investment mix\nThe diagram above explains the sweet spot of a balanced investment\nmix, where we have traded off technical vs product investment. Over\ninvesting with a product feature heavy backlog likely indicates an\nunderinvestment in technical debt and runway, leading to under-engineered\nsolutions, whereas over investing with a technology heavy backlog likely\nindicates an underinvestment in customer valued features and\nover-engineered solutions. It’s very hard to know when the balance is\nperfect. It’s likely to change over time as your company grows and\npivots.\nAn example of under-engineering we often encounter is when a product\nhas problems with availability. This issue means the development team\nhas to spend time fighting fires, which reduces focus and affects their\nproductivity. While this might be sustainable when you are small, if\nyour customer usage spikes (in hypergrowth), the team becomes\noverloaded, and customer experience is affected. That debt repayment\nwill always come due when your business can least afford it.\nA different imbalance results if the technical team does too much\nearly optimization, and they end up over-engineering. An example of this\nis overfitted architectures that are built to handle hundreds of\nthousands of users when the company only has ten. When the startup\npivots, a lot of that work ends up being thrown away. There is always a\nbalance to strike between building the product to be scalable in the\nfuture vs building what you need right now to survive.\nThe important thing is to be able to spot when this mix is\nimbalanced, and be able to correct it. A continuous improvement process\nis incredibly important. If a team (at product team level or a\nmanagement team) is aware of their shared goal, then a cross-functional\ngroup can assess the balance regularly, and use data as a guide. Some\ndata will be quantifiable, and some will be more subjective. Information\nyou can use to guide you includes:\n- Collecting individual opinions – does an engineer feel productive and\nmotivated? Does a product manager think the team is efficient?\n- Productivity metrics – How fast can we test and build a new feature?\n- View of current state and near-term future state – Are we overcomplicating\nbuild out for the sake of future scalability?\n- Product growth – Do we know how we are progressing towards a product’s goal?\nAre there enough analytics, user testing and customer feedback to confirm that\nour product investments are paying off?\n- Trends – As we build more features or increase users, how are metrics\ntrending? For example, look at metrics like the build time, the lead tiime to deploy\nto production, and the amount of incidents. As complexity increases, technical\ninvestment should bring them under control, and reduce toil for developers.\nAn experienced technologist that has scaled a technical platform is\nhighly valuable. They can interpret the data, using their intuition to\nspot potential future problems, while taking a pragmatic point of\nview.\nAccount for cross-functional requirements\nA good product isn't just a product with the latest features.\n- It must be built to be performant, reliable and stable.\n- It should be cost efficient – the cost of operating the product shouldn’t\nexceed the revenue that the product generates.\n- The underlying architecture of the product should enable future feature\ndevelopment to occur quickly and efficiently.\n- It should have in mind client expansion and be able to scale, without too\nmuch rework.\n- It shouldn’t put private customer or business data at risk.\nThese and many other qualities of a product fall under the umbrella\nof cross-functional requirements. Failing to account for these\nrequirements in the interest of getting new features out the door\ncreates compounding problems.\nSome problems are more obvious because you can observe them. They’re\nnoticeable when a customer complains. Others are only going to be\nnoticeable over the long term. Martin Fowler talks about the importance of keeping internal quality\nhigh – doing refactoring, creating automated tests, decoupling your\narchitecture. Early stage companies tend to skip this, for short term\nproductivity increases. This might be the right decision, but once they\nthink about adding more teams internal quality has to be addressed, or\nlong term value creation is forfeited.\nBalancing the backlog\nCreating a balanced backlog starts with trust, as it’s fundamentally\na negotiation between product and engineering. We recommended that every\nproduct leader works to build a close, collaborative relationship with\ntheir technical counterparts, and vice-versa. There will and should be\nmany difficult discussions as you work to find balance. A startup has\nvery limited resources, and often has to make hard trade-offs between\nimproving the developer experience and building new features.\nProductive negotiation depends on transparency, the ability to share\ndetailed information, and the desire to see the situation from the other\nperson’s perspective. If a product manager understands the technical\narchitecture and strategy, they can suggest ideas that are easier to\nbuild. If a technical person understands the reasoning and research\nbehind a product strategy, they can suggest alternative solutions that\nthe product person hasn’t thought of, e.g. utilizing ML/AI to solve a\nproblem.\nWhen negotiating a backlog, startups often find it challenging to\nunderstand the relative impact between potential investments — and\nbecause usage and revenue metrics are easy to obtain and well\nunderstood, work that will impact those is often prioritized, which\npulls the investment mix out of balance. To counteract this, we\nrecommend finding metrics that allow you to measure the impact of\ntechnical investment as well. Each situation is different, but there are\na number of research-supported, de facto standards shown to improve\nlong-term productivity that you can use as a starting point.\n- Focus on DevOps and DX outcome-driven metrics. Reading maximizing developer effectiveness\nis a good starting point.\n- In the Thoughtworks Scaleup Studio, we have a number of sensible\ndefaults,\nthat come from a study of what practices and technologies that successful\nscaleups are using. This includes continuous delivery, domain-oriented\nmicroservices, prudent use of technical debt, building experimentation processes\nand infrastructure.\n- Set a non-negotiable quality bar and keeping to it. For example, each\nlanguage has a set of good practices that we can easily check our work against, automatically.\nProduct vs Engineering collaboration approach as you grow\nPhase 1\nExperimenting\nThe startup itself is one team.\nPreliminary working aggreements and assets to describe mission statement.\nInvestment mix is heavily oriented towards product investment. Often building to improve knowledge and not a\nworking product (e.g. throwaway prototypes).\nExperiments with different economic models.\nPhase 2\nGetting Traction\nThe company starts to split off into sub-teams, still\nthinks of itself as “one big team.”\nWorking agreements become more concrete\nCustomer value assets are refined and used in onboarding and\norientation. Economic model becomes clearer, but still flexible.\nHire your first non-founder product and engineering leaders.\nInvestment mix is still heavily product-oriented, focused on\ncreating a durable product — key foundational investments to support\nscale.\nPhase 3\n(Hyper) Growth\nToo large to operate as “one big team”, decomposes into\nstream-aligned teams.\nCross-functional teams of leaders are created for middle\nmanagement. First platform engineering teams created.\nNo longer searching for new markets. Investment mix doubles down\non the value your products create.\nCustomer value, business strategy and economic model assets are\nnow quite concrete, very slow to change, and designed for\ndistribution.\nEach product and sub-product creates its own value statements and assets as needed.\nPhase 4\nOptimizing\nLeaders have to actively work against becoming siloed along\nfunctional lines.\nTeam structure starts to change to optimize for maximum autonomy\nand agency.\nStructures to support skill development and consistency across\nfunctional groups emerge.\nMultiple teams created to make work on stream aligned teams more\nefficient (platform engineering, product ops, design ops, etc).\nInvestment mix in core products becomes more focused on technical investment,\nincluding an investment in developer experience.",

    "content": "We all want to work within a healthy, positive team culture. Whether youâre a developer-heavy workforce or focused on customer success, the health of your internal teams will always spill out into the work itself â as well as any customer or client interactions.\nEvery organization can grow and improve in this crucial area.\nMost leaders have a general sense of the culture, but getting specific is harder. Many struggle with both how to measure team culture and what steps to take to improve it.\nTodayâs article helps with both. Weâll show you 5 key characteristics of strong team cultures and give you a step-by-step guide to get there.\nWhat makes a great work culture?\nSo, what exactly makes a workplace culture strong and healthy? And on the other side of the coin, what characteristics reveal an unhealthy work culture when theyâre missing?\nThe following five characteristics are a good start. No matter your industry or size, striving for these characteristics will move you in a healthier direction, helping with teamwork, positivity, retention, better mentoring, and more.\nTeam communication is open, honest, friendly, and productive\nOne of the clearest signs of a great work culture is frequent communication thatâs consistently open, honest, friendly, and productive.\nAlthough poor communication is one of the most frequent complaints in business, communication alone isnât a holistic solution. Getting the visibly angry guy to talk more is a start, but it isnât the end goal â resolving the anger is (preferably without involving human resources).\nHealthy teams tend to communicate more frequently, and that communication is itself healthier.\nIf you have team members struggling to find ways to communicate clearly, kindly, and in productive ways, the WINFY (What I Need From You) structure can be a powerful tool for remote or hybrid work settings.\n2. Team members trust one another and their managers\nHealthy team cultures involve high levels of trust, both on the peer level and the manager-to-team member level.\nWhen team members feel cared for and supported (again, on both the peer and the manager level), and when they consistently get what they need (including clear communication) from those parties, it builds trust.\nTrust takes time, of course. And building trust can be more challenging when team members donât physically interact with one another in a shared space, as is the case in remote or hybrid environments.\nItâs also helpful to remember that teams usually progress through four predictable phases (forming, storming, norming, and performing) of trust and culture bulidng.\nTrust levels naturally vary through this progression, even in healthy cultures. The difference is where your âtrust baselineâ sits: The higher that baseline, the healthier the team.\n3. Work is team-oriented\nDoes everyone on your team work towards a shared goal?\nGreat work cultures arenât highly competitive on an individualistic level. Instead, they orient work around a team, with multiple skilled contributors working toward a common goal.\nSet up Team Goals in Range\n- Create accountability by sharing information and updates across the team\n- Easily track how daily work connects to higher-level goals\n- Set a goal for metrics, objectives, and KPIs\n- With hashtags, see all artifacts, updates, and day-to-day progress in one place\n- Share goal updates with leaders via Slack or email\nThere are certain functions (sales in certain industries, for one) where thereâs no avoiding a competitive culture.\nBut even at intensely competitive and individualistic businesses (car dealerships come to mind), leaders can take steps to encourage team goals, not just individual ones.\n4. Team members share knowledge freely\nSiloing is one persistent enemy throughout the modern workplace. When information, knowledge, or work gets siloed, one group (department, team, or even an individual contributor) keeps that information locked in their silo. Other teams either donât know about it, canât access it, or must request access from gatekeepers.\nOur tech-driven and increasingly remote world inherently generates information silos. Unhealthy cultures build their own, too.\nIn contrast, healthy cultures work to break down naturally occurring silos, and they share knowledge freely instead.\n5. Help is given and received by team members whenever needed\nHow do team members at your business feel when they need to ask for help? Do you operate in an environment where questions are welcome opportunities for learning and coaching, or is asking for help seen as a sign of weakness?\nHealthy work cultures are environments where questions are welcomed â not punished or belittled.\nYour step-by-step guide for creating a great team culture\nIf your team culture isnât quite fulfilling these characteristics, then itâs time to start working toward improving it. Below is our step-by-step guide to help guide teams into better habits. Execute these six steps, and youâll propel your company forward toward a happier, healthier team dynamic and a stronger team culture.\n1. Create company values using everyone's input\nFirst, if youâve never put your company values to paper, nowâs the time to do so. And if youâve already formulated your values, consider whether itâs time to reevaluate them.\nHereâs the crucial step that many organizations miss: Involve your team or broader organization in the process.\nToo many employees donât know (or remember) their company values. They may have seen them in a slide deck during their orientation, but who remembers much from their first day?\nWhen you involve team members â solicit their input and incorporate what works into the company or team values â youâll gain buy-in and begin moving toward a healthier company culture.\nThis first step is especially crucial if youâre changing the work environment. For example, bringing some team members (or all of them) back to the office, or transitioning to a more long-term hybrid approach.\n2. Establish what it means to be a âteam playerâ at your company\nNext, apply those company values to a real-world question: What does a team player look like at your company or on your team?\nLetâs say one of your company values is to be a market leader in your space. Get your team members thinking through what a team player would do to contribute toward that value or goal. Would they hoard information? Engage in self-promotion at the expense of teammates? Or would they willingly share whatever tactics have made them successful?\nScale this exercise across all departments and roles, and youâll soon have a robust collection of tangible ways to work toward a healthier company.\n3. Build goals, milestones, and objectives around your values\nNext up is ensuring that every milestone, goal, and objective you create has a solid foundation in your company values.\nAs companies grow and mature, they tend to face greater complexity. Scaling existing processes and services adds complexity on its own, and any new products or service areas do so at an even greater pace. Before long, itâs easy for businesses to lose focus on those company values from step one.\nHealthy teams understand why theyâre doing what theyâre doing. They can draw a straight line from their tasks or broader projects to specific company values.\nWhen you find objectives or goals that donât support company values, you find a problem: You either have a darling to kill, or you havenât created robust enough company values.\n4. Define roles and clarify how team members work together\nConfusion or lack of clarity surrounding roles is another clear sign of poor organizational health. All sorts of problems set in when team members donât understand how they are intended to work together or how various roles interact:\n- They donât communicate clearly and openly.\n- They canât build trust and constantly feel let down by other team members (who themselves may not know anythingâs gone wrong).\n- They struggle to work toward shared goals and canât get clarity on shared responsibilities.\n- They donât share knowledge freely or with the right people.\n- They donât know who to ask for help when they need it\nDo any of these sound familiar? They are the opposite of the five characteristics of positive team culture we discussed earlier!\nWork as hard as you can to create clearly defined roles and document this information so that any team member can find it if needed. Only once this clarity exists throughout your organization will you start building a healthier culture.\n5. Use trust-building strategies to connect your team\nHealthy teams will naturally build some level of trust, but you can enhance or speed up this process by using strategic trust-building activities.\nThe days of corporate retreats in the woods are pretty much gone, and creating effective, non-cringeworthy virtual versions is a challenge. But it can be done â even simple icebreaker-style games at the beginning of team meetings can build small amounts of trust among group members through problem-solving, social interaction, and more. Compound this over time, and the results add up.\n6. Have fun as a team!\nLast, healthy teams enjoy each other and can easily have fun together. One way to help foster that feeling of camaraderie is to actually schedule fun events as a team.\nYes, a half-day âfunâ event is a hit to productivity. But in the long run, the bigger productivity hit is working on a toxic, unhealthy team.\nBuilding team culture through fun initiatives and icebreakers are worth the effort and the time.\n- Drawing games â From competitive, team-based games like Draw Battle to collaborative games like Gartic Phone, drawing games are one of the best ways to create moments of fun and connection on your team. Laughter isnât just a powerful stress reliever â itâs also a great way to foster team connectedness, especially on remote teams, where spontaneous casual interactions are harder to come by.\n- Gatheround â Gatheround turns video meetings into fun online gatherings. The video platform pairs off mentors and mentees, tees up prompt cards for interesting conversations that go beyond the boundaries of the everyday grind, and provides pre-made templates for monthly leadership meetings, socials, and more.\n- Range â Range integrates team building into the daily flow of work, helping teams stay in sync about what theyâre working on and how theyâre doing.\n- Offer brown bag sessions to discuss important topics and ideas (even virtually)\nWhat are the different types of corporate culture?\nHealthy companies donât all look the same. Most corporate cultures fit into one of four categories, and youâll find healthy work cultures in all four categories. What works well for one company may not be the right choice for yours.\nHereâs a quick overview of these four corporate cultures as defined by Elliott Jaques way back in 1951, plus pros and cons for each.\nType 1: Clan culture\nClan culture focuses on the team as a tribe or clan, a close-knit group of people tied together in a unique way. You see clan culture in many startups and small businesses along with family-run businesses. Clan culture doesnât love formal, distance-creating structures and prefers a direct, happy model of interaction.\nWith clan culture, all teammates are like one big, happy family that works well together, communicates intuitively, and accomplishes a lot.\nPros\n- Family atmosphere creates tightly bonded teams\n- No silos here\n- Can be fast-moving and agile, without bloated structures to bog it down\nCons\n- Doesnât scale well: Growth requires structure and strong decision-making\n- Families fight without a hierarchy or authority: Peer personalities can clash\n- Fear of disagreeing: Group mentality makes speaking out more difficult\nType 2: Adhocracy culture\nAdhocracy takes the flexible, low-structure approach of clan culture but removes the clan component, focusing instead on achievement (usually individual achievement), risk-taking, and innovation. Many tech companies take the adhocracy approach, where âfail fastâ is a common mantra and innovation is practically a religion.\nPros\n- Moves fast and flexibly\n- Egalitarian approach rewards good ideas from anyone, regardless of rank\n- Usually creates high levels of employee engagement\nCons\n- Can lead to unhealthy individual competition and infighting\n- High-stakes risks donât always pan out, which can damage or even destroy a business\nType 3: Market culture\nMarket culture focuses on results. This culture is common in established businesses where flexibility isnât as common. Successful companies donât happen by accident, so the structure and strategy that got them this far is worth maintaining.\nIn market culture, thereâs constant talk of targets, deadlines, results, and performance. This culture has a shared focus on individual and team performance, both in service of more and more results.\nPros\n- Results-focused\n- Support for professional development is common (better employees, better results)\n- Team members usually enjoy rallying to a cause and celebrating big wins\nCons\n- Constant push for results runs the risk of burnout\n- Employees may feel like cogs in a machine, not whole people\n- Failing to achieve results can destroy morale and team culture\nType 4: Hierarchy culture\nHierarchy culture is the most formal and traditional style, with an org chart that can be clearly laid out with a very powerful person at the top. Chain of command, working your way up the corporate ladder, and formal reporting structures are all common here.\nPros\n- Most likely to have clearly defined roles and responsibilities\n- Policies and procedures are well documented\n- Clear chain of command for decision-making\nCons\n- Prone to bloat (layers upon layers of management)\n- Tends to be extremely rigid and full of red tape\n- Doesnât support creativity or outside-the-box thinking\nBuild a fun, efficient, and collaborative team culture with Range\nGreat leaders and high-performing teams always seem to enjoy good team culture, but this isnât as automatic as it seems.\nAn effective team culture doesnât happen by accident. It takes effort and intentionality to build a strong team marked by cohesion â not to mention the right set of tools.\nRemote and hybrid teams deal with additional complexities created by distance.\nRange can help: Our powerful platform for asynchronous check-ins keeps teams and managers plugged in and connected, no matter the distance.",

    "content": "Table of contents\n- Donât try and cover too much\n- Align at the beginning of the day\n- Donât stray from the daily huddle agenda\n- Donât create separate huddles for each internal project\n- Start and end your huddle on time\n- Keep the tempo upbeat and engaging\n- Use Range as a meeting management tool to stay on track\n- Run your daily huddles on a regular basis\nFootball team or not, thereâs power in the act of huddling.\nHeads come together to align focus, discuss tactics, maybe even recalibrate. A few moments where, together a team, you align on your next play and break with a sense of clear next steps.\nSo whether your teamâs tackling opponentsâ¦or a product backlog, running tactical playsâ¦ or tactical meetingsâ¦\nA regular team huddle can help you unlock greater teamwork and efficiency. In this article, weâll give you the play-by-play of how to run a daily huddle that sets your team up for victory.\n8 Tips for Amazing Daily Huddles\n1. Donât try and cover too much\nWhen you try to cover too much, youâll go over time. A daily huddle is about building your rhythm and creating shared focus on your team â not discussing even tiny detail. Keep things focused and moving at a good pace. For instance, in your problem-solving section, make sure to triage issues quickly or take it offline after the meeting.\n2. Align at the beginning of the day\nDaily huddles work best when they happen at the beginning of the day. Especially with remote work, finding a time that works for teams spread across time zones can be challengingâwhich is why many teams opt to use an async daily huddle or check-in.\n3. Donât stray from the daily huddle agenda\nYouâve only got 15 minutes, so itâs crucial to use an agenda (see below!) and stick to it!. Also, since itâs all about building a rhythm, itâs important to follow the same format every time so that folks know what to expect and the huddle becomes an easy-flowing, second nature practice.\n4. Donât create separate huddles for each internal project\nWeâve all been on teams where youâre spread across multiple projects and end up attending back-to-back meetings all morning because of it. Avoid this with your daily huddles.\nTry to cover most of your teamâs projects in one. If it gets too large or cumbersome, consider moving to an asynchronous format rather than having many separate huddles.\n5. Start and end your huddle on time\nMost teams do huddles first thing in the morning. Start right on time even if you have stragglers. Use a timer and end the meeting on time, whether you got through everything or not. This will slowly train attendees to keep things moving more quickly.\n6. Keep the tempo upbeat and engaging\nThe best daily huddles move quickly and have a high degree of engagement and collaboration. Try kicking the meeting off with a fast team-building question to get the dialog going and make sure to build in space to celebrate successes (even early wins are big).\n7. Use Range as a meeting management tool to stay on track\nSince itâs such a brief meeting, every second matters. This is why itâs key to have a facilitator whoâs experienced at keeping things on track.\nMany teams find it helpful to use Range as a meeting management tool, since it helps you move through the agenda in real-time and times out each topic for you. We also put together a facilitation cheatsheet your team can follow to keep your daily huddle on track.\n8. Run your daily huddles on a regular basis\nAgain, rhythm is key. With the huddles, itâs important to get into the daily cadence so you can spot issues early on and triage blockers as they come up.\nDaily goal tracking as part of the huddle keeps teams marching toward a common goal and helps individuals feel purpose and progress in their day-to-day work. It also builds greater team accountability.\nYour daily huddle agenda\nHereâs an example agenda you can use to execute an effective daily huddle on your own team, including some tips to get the most out of your time.\nCheck-in (2 minutes)\nHowâs everyone doing? (Red/yellow/green)\nTip: Swap this out with a fast team-building question every other day to boost engagement.\nFocus areas (3 minutes)\nWhat are you focused on for the next 24 hours?\nTip: Only share key activities, meetings, and decisionsÂ â not every granular detail of how youâll be spending the next day.\nMetrics + wins (5 minutes)\nHow are we tracking toward product metrics? What wins can we celebrate?\nTip: Prepare these ahead of time so you donât have to spend time during the meeting pulling up your metrics tracker or having people think of what to share.\nProblem-solving (5 minutes)\nWhere are you stuck? What issues should we all be aware of?\nTip: Encourage honest sharing by taking time to share your own blockers upfront. As a general rule, if someone goes a few days without sharing any type of blocker, there are probably bigger issues youâre not seeing.\nIs a daily huddle different from a daily standup?\nThe daily huddle and daily standup are two names for the same type of meeting. Some teams also refer to it as the daily scrum meeting.\nAll are designed to be fast and focused, and typically revolve around team members sharing a brief status update and asking for help on blockers.\nOne area where daily huddles differ slightly is that oftentimes teams also use them for a quick check-in around product metrics.\nBring your team to victory with huddles in Range\nWhether you choose to run them live or asynchronously, Range has tools built in that help you maximize daily huddle time.\nAsync daily huddles in Range\nIf youâre not looking to add another meeting to the mix, Range Check-ins are a great way to get all the benefits of the daily huddle asynchronously instead.\nWith async daily huddle software, you can\n- Build alignment around in-flight work, wins, and goals while also reducing meeting load\n- See how everyoneâs doing (red/yellow/green + emoji) â team-building questions are built-in too\n- Easily share a huddle update each morning in 5 minutes or less\n- Customize prompts (https://www.range.co/blog/check-in-prompts) to fit your teamâs huddle format\n- Connect tasks and context from your teamâs other tools to create more meaningful updates\n- Flag blockers or tag teammates to get the help you need\n- Share and read each otherâs daily huddles directly from Slack or Microsoft Teams\nâ[Before we started using Check-ins], it was impossible for teammates to see what they could pitch in and help with. What Iâm seeing now is totally different and part of our culture. People are seeing items in Check-ins, seeing theyâre working on similar things, and inviting each other to collaborate.â â Kristin Toole, Senior Manager at Adobe\nDaily huddle meetings with Range\nIf your teamâs more a live meeting type of crew, Range has daily huddle software for that too.\n- Seamlessly built your agenda and pull in relevant huddle topicsâlike metrics, wins, and blockers\n- Kick things off with an opening round or check-in, Range has over 300 team-building questions built-in\n- Facilitate like a pro, with a spinner to decide who speaks next and topic timers to keep everyone on track\nDaily Huddle FAQs\nWhatâs a daily huddle?\nThe daily huddle meeting is a brief, 15-minute meeting where team members come together to share progress, work through quick tactical issues, and set next steps.\nIt's a daily meeting and normally follows a standard format each time, for consistency and rhythm.\nHuddles (sometimes called standups) are used across a variety of industries, not just tech, to improve collaboration and keep information flowing across the team.\nHow did daily huddles start?\nThe practice of huddling up as a team originally came from Paul Hubbard, a deaf quarterback who played football at Gallaudet University in the 1890s.\nHis team used sign language to communicate plays but found it too easy for opponents to see the signs and pick up on what was coming. Hubbard came up with the idea of circling up so the team could still communicate without giving away plays.\nTaking lessons learned from the football huddle, the practice was adopted by medical professionals in the 1980s as a way to more effectively hand-off patient updates at the end or beginning of a shift. Later, huddles were adopted by the agile development community as a way to bring focus and alignment in working toward shared product goals.\nDoes a daily huddle need to be an in-person meeting?\nShort answer: No. While a daily huddle can be a synchronous touchpoint, many teams choose to run them asynchronously instead.\nEspecially if your remote team is co-located across a couple of different time zones, asynchronous can offer more flexibility on the timing aspect while still keeping everyone aligned.\nAsync is also beneficial for teams with a high meeting load already who are trying to reduce some of their meeting dependency.",

Follow this elaborate How-To Guide to facilitate team alignment session with Team Canvas.\nFor instructions for the full Team Canvas, scroll down.\nYou can also find these instructions on Medium: Team Canvas Basic and Team Canvas Complete.\nTeam Canvas Basic is a strategic framework that helps team members to kick off projects and align on common vision. Based on our experience with startups and creative groups, it is made to smoothly start collective projects, let people learn about each other and accumulate enough momentum to get going.\nTeam Canvas Basic works best at the following touchpoints:\n- creating a team;\n- kicking off a project;\n- welcoming new team member (e.g. freelancer joining the team);\n- basic team alignment meeting.\nIt's a good idea to get team members on board before using Team Canvas Basic. Here are few ideas of how you might introduce the framework:\nHey guys! We're starting a team and many of us have never worked with each other before. I've come across this handy tool, Team Canvas Basic, that helps team members to learn most basic things about each other and get aligned on their goals and expectations. The meeting should take about half an hour. Should we try it out?\nHey guys, we have Marie joining the team this week. I thought it might be useful for all of us to take Marie into details with a short Team Canvas session, so we all are on the same page about our goals, roles and team culture. What do you think?\nHey guys! I was thinking that we could spend some time to structure the way we work together. There is a good tool for that called Team Canvas. It might help us understand what we do and why, where we aim at and what our guiding principles are, so we are more aligned as a team. What would you say if we schedule half an hour meeting to quickly go through Team Canvas steps?\nMaterials:\n- Team Canvas Basic recreated on a whiteboard, or on a big enough piece of paper (e.g. flipchart paper or A0/A1)\n- Blocks of sticky notes, one for each participant, different colors\n- Sharpies or pens to write on stickies (use thick enough pens so everyone can see the writing)\n- A device with a timer function\nIntroduce the team canvas as a tool to align the team members and get better at understanding goals, roles and values of your team.\nGo through each step with the team, making sure you ask the questions for each segment. Encourage people to write their answers on stickies and talk about them with the team. Make sure to agree on all fields.\nUse timer for each step to apply some time pressure so the team really focuses on getting to the point in each section discussion.\nIf some conversations take rather long time or seem to touch upon bigger issues, consider parking those questionsthem during the Team Canvas session and planning a separate meeting to address them specifically..\nAsk the team members to agree on common goals and mention their personal goals for the project.\nQuestions:\n- What we as a group really want to achieve? What is our key goal that is feasible, measurable and time-bounded?\n- What are our personal goals that we want to share with each other?\nExamples:\n- Become the leading car sharing company in our region by 2017.\n- Create a 100M company in the area of Internet of Things by fall 2016.\nAsk people to put their names on stickies, as well as their roles. If a person has multiple roles, use separate post-its.\nQuestions:\n- What are our names?\n- What are the roles we have in the team?\n- How are we called as a team?\nExamples:\n- Max: CEO; Marie: Design & Programming\n- Name of the team: BoldCar\nAsk the team to go one step beyond their common goal, and ask them why they do what they do.\nQuestions:\n- Why are we doing what we are doing in the first place?\n- What is something more important, which makes us pursue our common goal?\nExamples:\n- Create positive impact on people's lives through social innovation\n- Make people’s life easier and stress-free through innovation in the field of Internet of Things\nAsk the team what are the core values - the most important principles - that they want to share within the team. The team should agree on values, so everyone accepts the final set.\nQuestions:\n- What do we stand for?\n- What are guiding principles?\n- What are our common values that we want to be at the core of our team?\nExamples:\n- Trust\n- Creativity\n- Quality\n- Transparency\n- Mutual understanding\n- Equality\n- Respect\nAsk the team to agree on common rules and activities. Think of this as of outcome of the previous sections: a concrete set of rules and activities they want to implement.\nQuestions:\n- What are the rules we want to introduce after doing this session?\n- How do we communicate and keep everyone up to date?\n- How do we make decisions?\n- How do we execute and evaluate what we do?\nExamples:\n- Keeping things within group confidential\n- Weekly status updates\n- Communication over Slack + Skype for calls\n- Dinners together every second week (Max as organizer)\n- Workday: starting from 9 to 10, meetings start at 10\n- Keeping workday to 8 hours, except when it’s needed to shorten it a bit towards more\nAs you close The Team Canvas workshop, ask the team members to tell about one single most important insight that they gained during the workshop.\nIt is recommended to repeat the Teamwork Canvas session with each new member joining the team.\nTeam Canvas Basic consists of 3 key areas:\n- What the team is: roles and goals\n- Why the team is doing what it's doing: purpose and values\n- How the team is going to achieve what it needs to achieve: rules and activities\nAs a facilitator of the session, you might be asked something like this: ‘How are we supposed to answer this question? What is that you expect us to say here?’, etc. It is important to understand that The Team Canvas creates context for the team, rather then content, and therefore all answers are valid. Gently reply to such questions: 'How would you answer if you knew? What do you think the answer should be?'\nTeam Canvas Basic is working well with short-term projects and for the purpose of kicking off a new team. If you want to align on common vision and resolve conflict, or create great team bonding for a longer project, consider using Team Canvas Complete.\nTeam Canvas is a strategic framework that helps bring team members on the same page. Based on our experience with startup teams and creative agencies, it is made to align teams, increase cohesion and performance and to create productive team culture, fast.\nTeam Canvas works across multiple touchpoints:\n- creating a team;\n- clarifying goals and addressing overall team performance (e.g. when you feel stuck as a team, or when you need to get a lot of stuff done);\n- growing and onboarding new team members;\n- general alignment sessions (recommended every 2-3 months).\nBefore you use the canvas, make sure to get everyone in the team on board to do it. You might want to take a lead and suggest the tool to your team. Here are a couple of ways to introduce the framework:\nHey guys! Since we are forming the team now, I’d like to propose to do a session on creating our team structure and getting to know each other. Each of us might have had one of those previous experiences with teams when things didn’t really go that well. So why don’t we invest some time to make sure we are aligned and ready for a kickoff?\nHey guys, our work was a bit fuzzy lately, and I thought we could spend some time clearing things up and getting on the same page. There is a good tool for it called Team Canvas, which may help us get aligned and a bit more structured as a team. What do you say if we use it for an alignment session?\nAs you know, we are a small team and getting a new person on board is a big decision. We want to make sure we all agree on core things and will work great together. What do you say if we run a session with this tool, The Team Canvas, making sure we are aligned on our vision and core values, and have a match?\nMaterials:\n- Team Canvas recreated on a whiteboard, or on a big enough piece of paper (e.g. flipchart paper or A0/A1)\n- Blocks of sticky notes, one for each participant, different colors\n- Sharpies or pens to write on stickies\n- A device with timer function\nIntroduce the team canvas as a tool to align the team members and get better at understanding goals, roles and values of your team.\nGo through each step with the team, making sure you ask the questions for each segment. Encourage people to write their answers on stickies and talk about them with the team. There are fields that all team should agree on: 1. People and Roles; 2. Goals; 4. Purpose; 5. Values; 9. Rules and culture. The rest of the fields can be filled individually, with no particular need to be agreed upon.\nAsk people to put their names on stickies, as well as their roles. If a person has multiple roles, use separate post-its.\nQuestions:\n- What are our names?\n- What are the roles we have in the team?\n- How are we called as a team?\nExamples:\n- Max: CEO; Marie: Design & Programming\n- Name of the team: BoldCar\nAsk the team to agree on common goals.\nQuestions:\n- What you as a group really want to achieve? What is our key goal that is feasible, measurable and time-bounded?\nExamples:\n- Become the leading car sharing company in our region by 2017.\n- Create a 100M company in the area of Internet of Things by fall 2016.\nAsk the team members about their individual goals they have for the project.\nQuestions:\n- What are our individual personal goals for this project?\n- Are there personal agendas that we want to open up?\nExamples:\n- Become more confident at iOS development [Marie]\nAsk the team to go one step beyond their common goal, and ask them why they do what they do.\nQuestions:\n- Why are we doing what we are doing in the first place?\n- What is something more important, which makes us pursue our common goal?\nExamples:\n- Create positive impact on people's lives through social innovation\n- Make people’s life easier and stress-free through internet of things innovation\nAsk the team what are the core values - the most important principles - that they want to share within the team. The team should agree on values, so everyone accepts the final set.\nQuestions:\n- What do we stand for?\n- What are guiding principles?\n- What are our common values that we want to be at the core of our team?\nExamples:\n- Trust\n- Creativity\n- Quality\n- Transparency\n- Mutual understanding\n- Equality\n- Respect\nAsk the team to share the key pieces of skills (both hard skills and soft skills) and assets available within the team. Don't dismiss ‘insignificant’ stuff. You might find that the team has capacity for martial arts, running marathons or persuading people. Encourage people to share something about themselves, as well as note important qualities they see in their teammates.\nQuestions:\n- What are the skills we have in the team that will help us to achieve our goals?\n- What are interpersonal/soft skills that we have?\n- What are we good at, individually and as a team?\nExamples:\n- Coding (iOS/Python/etc.)\n- Design\n- Being devoted and driven\n- Being visionary\n- Energy\n- Sales & pitching\nAsk the team to share the key weaknesses and areas for improvement that they see in themselves, as well as obstacles they face as a team. Make an accent on reporting what people can find in themselves, rather than discussing other’s weaknesses.\nQuestions:\n- What are the weaknesses we have, individually and as a team?\n- What our teammates should know about us?\n- What are some obstacles we see ahead us that we are likely to face?\nExamples:\n- Easily distracted [Marie]\n- Can be arrogant [Max]\n- Lack of structured communication [general], etc.\nAsk the team to express the needs they have in order to be successful. Think of this as a follow up to previous two sections: once team members expressed their strengths and weaknesses, they should be able to express the needs they have to amplify strengths and be at their best despite the weaknesses.\nQuestions:\n- What does each member of the team needs to be successful?\n- How the team could help each member with their needs?\nExamples:\n- Some «me time»\n- More clear weekly status updates\n- Help and coaching\n- Trust\n- Fun\n- Stability\nAsk the team to agree on common rules and activities. Think of this as of outcome of the previous sections: a concrete set of rules and activities they want to implement.\nQuestions:\n- What are the rules we want to introduce after doing this session?\n- How do we communicate and keep everyone up to date?\n- How do we make decisions?\n- How do we execute and evaluate what we do?\nExamples:\n- Keeping things within group confidential\n- Weekly status updates\n- Communication over Slack + Skype for calls\n- Dinners together every second week (Max as organizer)\n- Workday: starting from 9 to 10, meetings start at 10\n- Keeping workday to 8 hours, except when it’s needed to shorten it a bit towards more\nAs you close The Team Canvas workshop, ask the team members to tell about one single most important insight that they gained during the workshop.\nWhen using complete Team Canvas, it is good to keep in mind that it consists of 4 parts:\n- What the team is: roles and goals (both common and personal)\n- Why the team is doing what it's doing: purpose and values\n- Who are the team members: their strengths, weaknessess and needs\n- How the team is going to achieve what it needs to achieve: rules and activities\nAs a facilitator of the session, you might be often asked something like this: ‘How are we supposed to answer this question? What is that you expect us to say here?’, etc. It is important to understand that The Team Canvas creates context for the team, rather then content, and therefore all answers are valid. Gently reply to such questions: 'How would you answer if you knew? What do you think the answer should be?'\nIt would be a good idea to to park conversations that seem to take too much time of the team and arrange separate meetings to address these issues.\nWe recommend to repeat Team Canvas sessions once in a while, especially when a new team members join.",

    "content": "One of the oldest truisms in sales is that recruiting new clients costs more than retaining them (five to 25 times more costly, depending on the industry).\nThe recent news about inflation has all companies rightfully worried about their short-term financial prospects. Companies targeting B2B buyers must work twice as hard to retain clients who may be looking to cut costs. Renewal time is always stressful for companies, but especially in a recessionary market.\nCompanies cannot afford to have different departments working in separate silos when so much is at stake. More than ever, customer success teams must be in complete lockstep with their sales teams—both should treat any renewal as a joint effort and success.\nRelated: 12 Tips To Align Sales and Customer Success\nHere are some key best practices to ensure every client will re-up during renewal time:\n1. Put the buyer first\nBuyers expect to get the royal treatment, regardless of how much (or little) they spend with your company. Even if you’re using tech automation, make sure to employ enough human touch to give each client this white glove treatment so they feel valued. This is especially important in today’s environment as companies are increasingly worried about every cent they spend.\nRelated: Customer Retention Playbooks 101: A Structured Approach to Keeping Customers Happy\n2. Start the renewal process on day one\nThe reality is that most companies have decided whether to keep working with you or not well before the actual renewal date comes.\nSales representatives must start the renewal process the first day a contract is signed by communicating with CS teams throughout the customer journey. Your team should also check in directly with the client to softly begin the “renewal” conversation well before that date.\nCompanies are looking for true partners in their suppliers, not order takers.\nOne way to set the tone for the relationship is to ask the client what three things they hope to accomplish within the year. Then work with the CS, engineering, and product teams to do whatever possible to help those customers achieve their goals. That makes the conversations throughout the year and the end of the term much more productive and positive.\n3. Drive closer collaboration between sales and customer success\nToo few sales teams are synced with customer success, minimizing valuable information sharing—and this could mean the difference between a renewal and a lost customer.\nCompanies should have regular internal, client-specific check-ins that bring together all meaningful stakeholders to discuss how your solutions increase revenue or cut costs for your clients. No one knows your clients better than your counterparts in customer success, so you should lean on their knowledge to make your sales pitch more effective.\n4. Use data to build credibility\nEnsure your customer success team always shares relevant data with the client throughout your relationship.\nYou should start with benchmarking your client’s state of play before using your solution, and then supply performance reviews at an agreed-upon cadence. Ideally, you can provide a simple number that demonstrates the ROI of your solution and really showcases your product’s value.\nMake sure to give them simple, yet impactful data that can be easily shared with their executives.\nUsing data helps build your credibility with customers. Make sure to give them simple, yet impactful data that can be easily shared with their executives — this will help tell a unified story and increase the likelihood of a renewal.\nRelated: 4 Unconventional Ways To Close More Deals With Data\n5. Understand the changing dynamics of your clients’ businesses\nYour CS and sales teams must know your clients’ business and competitive landscape almost as comprehensively as your client does.\nBy staying on top of industry news, competitor maneuvers, the industry at large, you can give your clients crucial intelligence they would either have to invest significant time to collect themselves or struggle to get elsewhere.\n6. Communicate a plan for the next year\nIf you’ve nailed all of the above, it will be easier for you to help your clients build a road map for the next few years.\nCompanies are looking for true partners in their suppliers, not order takers. You must demonstrate:\n- How your solution fits into your clients’ plans and\n- How it helps them tackle their biggest challenges now and in the future.\nBy anticipating what challenges and opportunities await your clients, you can demonstrate your value as a provider and strategic partner who can help them through any environment.\n7. Putting it all together\nUnfortunately, B2B customers have less brand loyalty than ever before. A Wunderman Thompson Commerce survey of US businesses found that 55% had switched suppliers in the 12 months preceding the survey. Additionally, many are likely to closely monitor costs in an unfavorable environment.\nThis means B2B companies must work even harder and, more importantly, smarter to prove their value to customers.\nWith unified customer success and sales teams, a robust approach to solving your clients’ most pressing problems, and data-driven storytelling on your side, you’ll be able to maximize your renewal success rate year after year.\nEdited by Kendra Fortmeyer @ Sales Hacker 2022",

    "age": "1,208 days ago",
    "content": "When it comes to change, some clients are more difficult to help than others. This post is not about clients that are difficult to help. This post is about the reasons that prevent a client from changing, even when doing so is necessary and would improve their results. Over the course of my time in sales and sales leadership, I have found that there is a small set of reasons that prevent clients from changing.\nIt can be difficult to recognize the true reason your client refuses to do things differently. Over many years, I have found four reasons that cause clients to maintain the status quo even when they need better results. The way I discovered these four client obstacles is that a number of clients were candid enough to tell me the truth about why they were unable to change.\nFour Reasons Clients Refuse to Change\n- Client commitments\n- Fear of their clients\n- Incentives\n- Fear of failure\nI would love to tell you that the reason clients avoid change is because they are deeply in love with the status quo. But as powerful as the status quo may be, many people in a struggling company have nothing good to say about the way things are, especially when they know that a significant change could improve their results and their experience. While we are not eliminating the status quo as our villain, there are other forces at work, some with a greater ability to prevent change.\nAs you will discover here, there are external and internal forces that protect the status quo and prevent change. Most of the time, your client will not disclose what prevents them from making the change they know is necessary. Here are details on each of the four reasons:\n- Client commitments: Some of your clients or prospective clients have contracts and commitments to their clients. Some of these relationships find your clients in a weaker position, especially when it comes to the pricing they are able to charge. I learned very early in my time in sales that a client with no leverage was often unable to invest in their own business, eventually falling behind competitors who were better at selling and increasing their prices. The more these companies fall behind, the worse their results.\n- Fear of clients: There are some clients and prospects that are afraid to change because they worry that making even necessary changes will cause their own clients to decide not to work with them. This fear may not be unfounded, as some of the company's clients are unwilling to change. In these cases, the sales force won the client by customizing their product or service to help them please their client. Because they fear having a conversation with their client about the change the client would need to accept, they refuse to address their poor results.\n- Incentives: Depending on your relationship with your client, you may or may not ever be aware that some highly placed people inside the company have incentives that prevent them from accepting change. Imagine you maxed out your commission plan. How happy are you to discover your plan has changed, and maxing it out is going to be much more difficult in the future? I have shown grown adults the cost savings they could enjoy by changing, only to have them tell me that my math was wrong. My math was fine, but no reason could convince them to change if it would harm their incentives. They were looking at their personal math.\n- Fear of failure: A person who has tried to change and failed is going to be shy to try again. If this same person works in a company with a punitive culture, you can expect them to try to avoid being penalized a second time. You might recognize that large companies tend to have a more political environment than smaller companies, even though the small company may also have an overly political culture. Others may just fear that any failure is a setback, even if there is no political price. Either way, one pays a personal price for failing, change is difficult.\nOver time, some of the clients with the reasons listed here will change.\nThe contact who has a client that isn't going to accept a higher price will, over time, recognize they need to make a greater investment to improve their results, allowing the company to make the necessary changes and pay a higher price. In my experience, external forces tend to force change through.\nThe company that fears changing the way they deliver results for their clients will likely be displaced by a competitor who offers a better way. Because they don't have the company's client, they have nothing to lose and everything to gain. It's also possible that the competitor can muster up the courage to have a conversation about the change they need to make. Some of this may be a timing issue for your prospective client.\nI have yet to see a company change if its managers are compensated in such a way that a change would reduce their incentives. When you can explain what's in it for the company but not answer the question \"What's it in it for me?\" you can expect them to err on the side of keeping their compensation.\nOf the four reasons clients refuse to change, the last is the one you may have the easiest time addressing. Over time, every company is going to make changes, even if they do so with some trepidation.\nThe salesperson who persists over time will find that every company will change, or eventually shrink and disappear. It may be quarters or years before the company makes the necessary change, but the ACDC environment is likely to cause them to change sooner than they believe.",

    "content": "You know what? Weekly team meetings suck. There, I said it. I know many of you were thinking it, but I went ahead and put it out there. People don’t like them. In fact, many people describe their departmental meetings as a complete waste of time. Others compare meetings to running in a circle like a hamster, it feels like you are moving, but you are getting nowhere! I have seen poorly executed meetings almost single handedly crush the culture of an organization. It is impossible to build an excellent company without a great culture as you can’t keep the A players that you need to succeed. Think about it, when was the last time you walked out of a meeting and thought “that was awesome!”? If you run effective team meetings, solve problems and follow the weekly meeting agenda each and every week you'll rid yourself of this meeting madness!\nI have good news for you, weekly team meetings don’t have to suck. If you work just a little bit at it, the time spent can be extremely productive and help drive your company towards its short and long term goals. Before you know it you will actually look forward to going to meetings. In fact, this topic is so big that we produced a video about it, which you can find at the end of the blog post. This also will be the first in a series of blog posts that will help you turn your boring status meetings into super productive adjustment meetings. Make sure that you sign up for our blog notifications, or check back frequently so that you can stay in the loop!\nAt the Rhythm Systems Breakthrough Conference, I had the pleasure of running a weekly meeting workshop. The topic was a good one that I knew would draw a lot of interest, but I didn’t know that it would require us to completely rework the entire room to double its capacity! Of course, the Rhythm Systems SuperGreen® team took care of all of the details so I could concentrate on the material for my workshop. The topic: How to Achieve Airtight Execution With Your Weekly Adjustment Meetings. The high interest in participating let me know just how big of an issue unproductive meetings are at many organizations.\nThere are hundreds, maybe thousands, of reasons that meetings don’t work. Meetings are one of the most expensive undertakings at any organization, yet very few people spend the time needed to work on having great meetings. There is a skill component to meetings that you can improve over time. Bring it up to the team at your next weekly meeting and see how eager they are to make the staff meetings more relevant, productive and fun. I am sure you’ll get a positive response and buy in from the team to work on it.\nIn analyzing hundreds of meetings, I have found that most problems fall into three overarching categories: preparation, operation and procrastination. Each of these will be addressed in future blog posts.\nWeekly Meeting Preparation Problems\n- Agenda doesn’t drive company growth\n- Team doesn’t do their homework prior to meeting\n- Poor annual or quarterly plans that aren’t execution ready\nWeekly Meeting Operation Problems\n- Culture does not foster accountability & transparency\n- Poor time management and no probing questions\n- Status updates versus working adjustment meetings\nWeekly Meeting Accountability (Procrastination) Problems\n- Ignoring facts and hoping they will go away\n- Lack of leading Key Performance Indicators\n- Not treating every week as essential in the 13 Week RaceTM\nWeekly Meeting Facilitation Problems\n- Always having the team leader be the facilitator, try passing the baton week after week to keep team on their toes.\n- Not keeping on the weekly team meeting agenda and using the meeting parking lot.\n- Not starting off with good news or something that fits your company culture to get the blood flowing, it doesn't need to be about work.\nYou spend a lot of your working time in meetings, so spend the appropriate amount of time working with your team to improve them. If you upgrade your meetings, you will turbo charge your teams’ performance. You’ll spend your time working on solutions to the key business challenges that your business is facing, and maybe just have a little fun doing it.\nHappy meetings, and I hope you enjoy our video! -Ted Skinner\nPhoto Credit: iStock by Getty Images\nAdditional Rhythm Systems Meeting Resources:\n4 Easy Steps to Fix Your Weekly Staff Meetings [Video]\nDownload Our Weekly Meeting Agenda\nAre You Having Weekly Meetings with Yourself?\nSupercharge Your Meetings with This Effective Weekly Meeting Agenda\n8 Ways to Make Weekly Meetings Strategic vs. Tactical (Video)\nWeekly Adjustment Meetings vs. Weekly Status Meetings (Infographic)\nConsider using Rhythm Software to run your weekly meeting, where the status and agenda are automatically created every week to keep you on track!",

    "content": "When the projects and sprints are over, the work isn’t done. (Wah! No, actually this is a good thing — trust us!) It’s essential to have an established framework for gathering and recording ideas, as well as a culture based on psychological safety, to make sure that your team feels comfortable giving honest feedback.\nSo how do you do it? Retrospective meetings provide that structure.\nWhat are sprint retrospectives?\nRetrospectives (or ‘retros’) are held at the end of each project or sprint to reflect on what went well, what needs to improve, and what ideas may have potential. The goal is to evaluate past performance to improve process efficiency, teamwork, workflows, interactions, and the team’s definition of done.\nRetrospectives have many benefits, including:\n- Identify challenges or opportunities for improvement in real-time\n- Create a safe space for teams to voice feedback and raise concerns\n- Improve collaboration by fixing workflows\nSprint retrospective meetings\nDuring a retrospective meeting, the team members gather together to discuss and analyze the successes and failures of the project, the effectiveness of the team's communication and collaboration, and the overall process used to complete the work.\nThe goal of sprint retrospective meetings is to identify areas of improvement and come up with action items to address them in future projects or iterations. Retrospectives are an essential part of continuous improvement and help teams to learn from their mistakes and make incremental improvements over time.\nTypes of retrospectives\nThere are many different types of retrospectives, but most of them make sure to touch on a few key points:\n- What went poorly?\n- What went well?\n- What can we do better next time?\nBasic retrospective\nA simple retrospective to understand what went well, what went poorly, what ideas the team has, and how to take action to make the next sprint or project better.\nProject retrospective\nReflect on a completed project and looks for opportunities to improve the way they work together in the future.\nThough most often used by agile teams following the Agile methodology, the project retrospective is also helpful for any team looking to reflect on project progress and encourage continuous improvement.\nSailboat retrospective\nAssess how well a project has been executed and identify areas for improvement. Sailboat retrospectives use a sailboat voyage as a memorable metaphor for the journey of completing a project or initiative from start to finish.\nStop, start, continue retrospective\nUse a stoplight as a metaphor to consider and define what your team should start, stop, and continue doing.\nRose, thorn, & bud retrospective\nUse this framework to identify things as positive, negative, or having potential with the metaphor of a rose, its thorns, and a rosebud.\nAsync retrospective\nA great remote retrospective option for distributed teams, conduct a retrospective asynchronously and reduce the number of meetings a team has to sit through.\nHow to run effective retrospective meetings\n1. Prepare for the retro\nTools\nTraditional, in-person retrospectives usually involve a whiteboard, some post-it notes, and some markers in a meeting room. Now, with increasingly hybrid and remote working environments, it’s not always possible to be in the same room. Even if you’re meeting in-person a digital collaboration platform like Mural is your best friend.\nIf you’re conducting a remote retrospective, be sure to agree on which video conferencing tool (like Zoom) the team will use to communicate effectively.\nParticipants\nNext, invite everyone that should be involved in the retrospective. You may not need to invite the entire team, just the main stakeholders involved the scope of the project or week sprint in question. This includes stakeholders like:\n- Product owners\n- Product developers\n- Scrum masters\nWe also recommend having an impartial facilitator to help keep the retrospective on task, allow for better collaboration among the key stakeholders, and record insights.\n2. Start the retrospective\nGet the team warmed up and set the stage with a quick icebreaker and any necessary introductions.\nKick off the retrospective meeting by explaining the purpose and any ground rules that the team should follow. This might include emphasizing the importance of open and honest communication, active listening, and respectful behavior.\n3. Review the project or sprint\nInvite team members to share their perspectives on what went well and what didn't during the project or iteration. You might use prompts such as \"What did we accomplish?\" or \"Did we achieve our sprint goal?\" and \"What could we have done differently?\" Encourage everyone to contribute and avoid jumping to conclusions or blame.\nBy the end of this step, you should be able to answer the following questions:\n- What went well?\n- What went poorly?\n- What ideas do you have?\n- How should we take action?\n4. Look for insights and common themes\nLook for patterns and themes in the data that emerges from the team's discussion. Ask questions to clarify and explore any areas of ambiguity. Identify strengths and areas for improvement.\n5. Decide on next steps\nConduct a brainstorm on possible solutions or new ideas that can make the next sprint or project better based on the feedback from this retrospective. Group similar or duplicate items and hold a vote to assign a priority to the changes.\n6. Wrap up the retrospective\nSummarize the insights and action items that were identified during the meeting, and encourage team members to follow up on their commitments. Thank everyone for their participation and remind them that the purpose of the retrospective is to improve future projects or iterations.\nTips for getting the most out of retrospectives\nUse a consistent format\nWhichever platform you choose to conduct your meetings and gather feedback, make sure to use that same framework regularly to build consistency and trust, as well as give yourself the opportunity to make direct comparisons with past sprints and carry over action items directly into your next retro.\nThere are many different approaches to sprint retrospective templates, but they generally follow a pattern of asking three questions: What went well? What needs improvement? What ideas do we want to test in the next sprint?\nGiven the above, there are many potential options for how to visualize the process. If this is a weekly meeting, our Weekly Team Retrospective template (set for a 30-minute max length) is a great place to start.\nAnother more basic approach is a simple ‘Start, Stop, Continue’ format — because of its simplicity, this can be used for teams, or even for one-on-one meetings to check in on progress and make adjustments.\nAdding another level of visual organization can help blend ideation with prioritization, and speed up innovation. For example, the Retrospective Radar template, designed by Anthony Coppedge, Global Agile Digital Sales Transformation Lead at IBM, builds in a further framework that helps managers understand what issues are under the team’s control, what they may be able to influence, and what areas there are of concern. By organizing the sticky notes from the initial feedback round inside the radar visual, managers can understand both the feedback and needs of their team at a glance.\nFor larger projects, our Quarterly Kanban and Retrospective template provides space for any backlog items, what’s being prepared for upcoming sprints, things that are in progress, any test results, and what has already been done — as well as any suggestions for improvements your team may have.\nAnd, the Project Retro template (built for a run time of 1-3 hours) includes an ice breaker exercise, and ample room for longer discussions within the usual framework.\nTime-box your meeting\nSprints are based on regular temporal cadences. Your sprint retrospectives should follow suit. In general, your meeting should be 45 minutes or less (especially if this is a weekly practice), though for larger projects or more irregular gatherings, you may want to have longer run times.\nIt’s important not to get bogged down too heavily in specifics or tactical thinking, so make sure to time-box your ideation and feedback sessions. Using tools like a timer for each section of your meeting helps create a basis of understanding and keeps things from stagnating.\nRead more: 5 Tips for Holding Effective Post-Mortems\nCreate concrete action items\nThe end of every meeting should mean you have actionable next steps. Because you’ve taken the time to not only brainstorm and identify problems together, but also organize that feedback in a framework that makes it clear what needs to be done to improve, what obstacles may be in the way, and what you’d like to test in the next sprint, assigning action items will become a natural part of the process.\nYour team will be energized because they’ll have a clear sense of purpose, responsibility, and confidence knowing that everyone has a shared understanding of the expectations and the mission.\nRemember: retrospectives don’t happen in a vacuum\nIssues raised in retrospectives should be openly discussed and addressed in other agile meetings. Be sure to provide status updates in daily stand-ups and include the action items when starting the next sprint planning session.\nNote: Be sure to look at the notes from previous retrospective meetings to ensure retrospective ideas are being addressed.\nThe bottom line: be prepared for your next retrospective\nTypically used in software development, but widely applicable to other uses, a retrospective is a meeting that occurs at the end of each sprint or project. The sprint retro is your team’s opportunity to reflect and learn from the previous sprint, identify team needs, and also plan exactly what ideas you’d like to test in the next sprint or project.\nThe 6 steps needed for a successful retrospective are:\n- Prepare with the right tools and participants\n- Start off the retro with an icebreaker\n- Review the project and cover the highlights\n- Look for insights and common themes\n- Decide on next steps\n- Wrap up the retro and follow-up\nMural is built for better sprint retrospectives\nA digital whiteboard is a great place to start, but there is so much more you can do with Mural to brainstorm more effectively, better elucidate problems, and build a pathway to success.\nSign up for a Free Forever account today, invite unlimited guests, and hit the ground running with one of our many Agile templates, built by experts like IBM and the LUMA Institute.\nFrequently asked questions about retrospectives\nWho should be involved in a retrospective?\nMake sure to have all the stakeholders present, whether in person or virtually, in order to get a holistic picture of what happened over the course of the last sprint. These stakeholders should include:\n- Product owners\n- Product developers\n- Scrum masters\nFind a time that is suitable for the whole team, and avoid meetings outside regular working hours. If this is not possible for some team members, reach out to them before sending the meeting invitation to make sure they are able to accommodate.\nWhat tools do you need for a retrospective?\nTraditionally, sprint retrospectives often involved using a physical whiteboard and sticky notes — now, with increasingly hybrid and remote working environments, it’s not always possible to be in the same room. Even if you’re meeting in-person a digital collaboration platform is your best friend.\nWith a shared digital collaboration space like Mural, you can quickly capture ideas with sticky notes, organize them however you like in an infinite canvas, and add tags for filtering and next steps. When the meeting is over, your team (and organization) has a record of the meeting that is interactive and valuable, rather than a photo someone may have snapped.",

    "content": "The Power of Values Statements\nCore Values are deeply held convictions, priorities, and underlying assumptions that influence your organization’s attitudes and behaviors. They’re the enduring, passionate, and distinctive core beliefs that serve as your sounding board for how you’ll behave as a team. This article outlines a few simple ways you can begin to identify your core values.\nYour core values and mission statement are part of your strategic foundation: the beliefs and purpose you and your team adhere to so you can achieve your vision of success.\nWhy Are Core Values Important?\nMost commonly comprised of 4-7 smaller, concise statements, core values become the guiding principles for how people in an organization are expected to behave, how teams treat each other, and how you expect your organization to treat your customers.\nThese statements are to be embedded in your every day, from daily actions to long-term strategic focus.\nA strategic plan is not complete without a declaration of the underlying beliefs in your organization. These core values need to guide your team as you develop your strategic plan, informing what strategic choices you will [or will not] make to stand with your values.\nGet the Free Guide to Identify and Live Your Core Values\nCore Values Answer These Questions\n- What key non-negotiables are critical to the success of the company?\n- What guiding principles are core to how we operate in this organization?\n- What behaviors do you expect to see from the team?\n- Are you willing to stand by these values no matter what the cost—for example, lost clients or lost revenue?\nAnatomy of a Core Values Statement\nAs a refresher from our what are core values statements, here is how a values statement is intended to be structured and written. This can be example and the free cheat sheet on developing your core values can be helpful to reference as you work with your team to identify your core values.\nNon-Profit Core Values\nIf you’re a non-profit, before starting this exercise, we also recommend looking at Prosper Strategies’ examples of non-profit values. It’s really helpful to reference in addition to the exercise below!\nHow to Identify Your Core Values\nSince values reflect the beliefs and behaviors of your team and organization, it’s not an exercise we recommend completing alone.\nYour values need to reflect your entire organization; we recommend completing this exercise with your broader team to reflect what your organization values holistically.\nMaterials Needed\n- Small Sticky Notes – 3 to 5 Per Person\n- A White Board or blank wall. Alternatively, you can use a whiteboard tool like Miro or Mural if you want to do this exercise virtually.\nStep 1: Set Up the Whiteboard\nSetting up this whiteboard is simple. The easiest way is to draw ten vertical columns across the board. As you complete this exercise, either virtually or with your team, you will use these columns as theme areas.\nWe also recommend adding these three core questions to the top of your whiteboard facilitation as prompts for your team to consider during the exercise:\n- What key non-negotiables are critical to the success of the company?\n- What guiding principles are core to how we operate in this organization?\n- What behaviors do you expect to see from our team?\nPro Tip:\nWe like adding these prompts above the exercise as guideposts for thinking. You’ll ask your team specific questions in step two, but these are still nice to consider as you complete the exercise.\nStep 2: Have Each Team Member Identify Your Core Values\nCore values are not created in an organization but instead identified from your team’s current behavior. Which is why you need your team to help identify your core values! The best core values articulate behavior your team already exhibits, which are essential to your success —so important they warrant being core values.\nProvide each person in the room with 3 to 5 small sticky notes. Choose ONE of the following questions. Then, ask everyone to write down their answers (one value per sticky note):\n- Identify up to 5 behaviors you see every day that are key to your success with your customers, with your team, and as an employer. e.g., Approachable: ask for feedback and be open to suggestions.\n- If you were hiring for a position on your team, what character traits would a candidate need to demonstrate to be a good fit for the organization? e.g., Detail oriented: know that details make the difference.\nPro Tip:\nIdentify current values, don’t create aspirational values. Your values statements should reflect current behaviors you consistently see and are critical to your culture.\nStep 3: Present and Organize\nAsk one person to report out first by placing the sticky notes horizontally on the whiteboard or wall.\nAsk each person in the room to add their values under an idea that is already on the wall. If a new value or theme is created, add a new column. As you discuss and add sticky notes, it should begin to look like this:\nStep 4: Choose Values Based on Themes\nBased on the values that have the most sticky notes, choose those as the core values of the organization. From your board, it will be easy to see which values are mentioned the most.\nStep 5: Discussion on Themes\nFor each value, quickly discuss “how we behave when we are living the value.” Capture this information on the whiteboard.\nPro Tip:\nIf it’s a one-word value, e.g. “Approachable,” describe what behavior your team expects to see when that value is in play. An example behavior of being approachable might include: asking for feedback and always keeping our minds open to suggestions.\nStep 6: Draft Your Values\nAssign someone to draft the values statements similar to that of the Zappos structure: core value theme and 1 or 2 sentences explaining the behaviors.\nPro Tip:\nTake the writing offline. Spending time wordsmithing as a group is not a good use of your time.\nEvaluation: Did You Get It Right?\n- Are these non-negotiables in how you operate?\n- Do these values clearly express how you expect your team to behave to be successful?\nFixing the cta placement",

    "content": "Refresher on The Definition of Core Values\nYour company’s core values must answer the question, “How will we behave?” In the context of your strategic planning process, core values help define and determine what is most important and non-negotiable to your organization.\nWhy are core values important?\nCompany core values are the articulation of the culture you want to permeate your team and the kind of behavior you hope and expect from each member. Check out the overview post on “what are core values” here! Save this article as the best way to structure your values.\nVideo Transcript – How to Write Core Values\nHi, I’m Erica Olsen with OnStrategy. Today’s whiteboard video is on core values. Your company’s core values answer the question, how will we behave? In a strategic planning process, you often hear, hey, we’re going to work on mission, vision values. So, we made this whiteboard video to help that piece of your strategic planning process.\nBut before we go too far, I just want to call out a critical point. Just because we say, mission and vision values doesn’t mean you need to define your core values as part of your strategic planning process. If you don’t have them, you’re starting from scratch. I recommend that you take values and put them into a dedicated process and work on that alone.\nA great process we love is from Change the Culture, Change the Game. Check it out.\nLet’s talk about what makes up a good core value, the components of it, how you know you did it right, and how you put it to use. So here is our anatomy of a core value. We love labels before the colon a value as a noun, in this case, respect and authenticity.\nThe most important part of core values is this piece: What behavior is expected? We are saying that this is how we expect everybody in the organization to behave, so that’s a great core value. We believe in connecting to the heart of the matter by listening respectfully and acting authentically.\nIdeally, you would have five to seven core values, no less than three. Something people can remember. Yes, Zappos has like 12. That’s good for them, but we recommend less. When asking if you got it right, ask yourselves,” Are these core values our non-negotiables?” Meaning absolutely everybody should behave this way in your organization? You would stand by them no matter what happens, no matter what, no matter what, and as I said before, the behavior is clear.\nSo now that you have your core values or you’ve refreshed them, just a consideration: If you are refreshing them, consider putting them in a survey in the first phase of your planning process to get feedback on people’s perspectives on the new ways it looks when we’re behaving differently with this core value.\nGreat question. How do we use it? Publish it, of course, right? Maybe posters, on your intranet, or at the bottom of your SIG block, depending on where you want to see them. Importantly, could you reinforce it? I would like to reinforce it at the beginning of every staff meeting. Pick one or call out where you saw value in practice the week before.\nFinally, from changing the culture, the game, and establishing intentional experiences that reinforce a core value. So, experiences in your organization reinforce respect and authenticity. So, with that, that’s a quick overview of the company’s core values.\nYou know how to get it right and construct strategies to make a difference in your organization. Don’t forget, as Peter Drucker said, culture eats strategy for lunch, and he’s right.\nWhy Do You Need Core Values in Strategic Planning?\nFirst, this question depends on where you are in the strategic planning process regarding core values. If you are defining core values for the first time, we wouldn’t recommend discussing core values in your more extensive strategic planning process, along with your mission and vision.\nInstead, we encourage you to create a dedicated process for your core values and work on them alone. Check out the book “Change the Culture, Change the Game” for ideas. Your organization’s culture depends on how well you define and live these core values, so they are worth space and time. We recommend including your stakeholder’s perspectives, but it can be hard to wordsmith your list of values together. Complete this exercise to identify your corporate values and have a dedicated writer create them instead.\nHowever, if you’re re-evaluating and refreshing a set of core values that you already have, by all means, include these values in your strategic planning process. Your core values will help you stay focused on what’s most important as you align your company’s mission statement and vision with them. We don’t always recommend a core value change in every planning process; use your best judgment to assess if you need a refresh to impact your company culture and the entire workforce.\nPro-Tip: Personal values differ from company core values! Collective behaviors and culture influence core values for your business, whereas personal core values reflect an individual.\nGet the Free Guide to Identify and Live Your Core Values\nHow to Write Nonprofit Core Values\nIf you’re a nonprofit, check out Prosper Strategies’ helpful post on four exercises to establish and actualize your nonprofit values. This is a helpful article for you to refer to as you work through writing your nonprofit values in the exercise below.\nHow to Write Core Values\nAs we jump into this 4-step exercise, check out this helpful breakdown on how to create core values for your organization. Also, don’t miss our post on 40 core values examples!\nStep 1: Write core values expressed as a single noun.\nWe always like to start by writing the value as a simple, singular noun. It helps make your values clear and easy to spot.\nLabels are beneficial for remembering and calling things out. So, could you start with a noun form of your core value? For example, one of our core values is “Respect and Authenticity.” Another is called “Forward Thinking.”\nHere is a list of common values expressed as nouns. We do not advocate using these as your own but as fodder for inspiration.\nHow to create values expressed as nouns:\n- Authenticity:\n- Service:\n- Communication:\n- Innovation:\n- Sustainability:\n- Curiosity:\n- Honesty:\n- Transparency:\n- Teamwork:\n- Empathy:\nStep 2: Writing a transition for the value to be expressed as a verb in the present tense.\nNext, you want to start a statement about your commitment to the value using a verb in the present tense. Core values are constant and require action, so your statements should be in the present. Following the examples for “Respect and Authenticity” and “Forward-thinking,” our statements begin with “We believe in…” and “We challenge…”\nHere’s how that might look in practice:\n- Authenticity: We believe in\n- Service: We strive to\n- Communication: We are committed\n- Innovation: We innovate together\n- Sustainability: We believe in\n- Curiosity: We approach\n- Honesty: We always\n- Transparency: We prioritize\n- Teamwork: We work\n- Empathy: We are\n- Excellence: We are\nStep 2: State the value in verb form.\nNow, you want to state the value in verb form. For “Respect and Authenticity,” we have “connecting to the heart of the matter.” For “Forward Thinking,” we decided to ascribe the action “continually pursuing innovation.”\nHere’s how that might look in practice:\n- Authenticity: We believe in connecting to the heart of the matter\n- Service: We strive to deliver the highest service standards in all we do\n- Communication: We are committed to the timely and transparent exchange of information\n- Innovation: We innovate together by using customer input\n- Sustainability: We believe in action to boldly address the climate emergency\n- Curiosity: We approach the world and each other with a sense of wonder\n- Honesty: We always act in the light of the truth and do the right thing.\n- Transparency: We prioritize transparency as a core principle of success\n- Teamwork: We work in total alignment and support each other\n- Empathy: We are empathetic, prioritize each other, and show kindness\n- Excellence: We are a successful business by showing up\nStep 3: State the behavior you expect to see as a result of the value.\nYou want it to be clear to each team member what behavior is expected. This step helps your core values statement be specific, clear, and unique.\nHere are our complete examples from above—notice the specific behavior expected is outlined at the end of each value:\n- Authenticity: We believe in connecting to the heart of the matter, as demonstrated by listening actively and acting with respect and authenticity.\n- Service: We strive to deliver service standards in all we do and seek improvement from feedback from our partners and customers.\n- Communication: We are committed to the timely and transparent exchange of information by encouraging respectful interactions through positive listening, positive intent, and understanding.\n- Innovation: We innovate together by using customer input to drive our product development to serve our customer needs best.\n- Sustainability: We believe in action to boldly address the climate emergency and commit to being a net-zero organization by 2026.\n- Curiosity: We approach the world and each other with a sense of wonder by always asking each other questions, actively listening, and thinking critically.\n- Honesty: We always act in the light of the truth and do the right thing by not withholding information, hiding setbacks, and providing the entire truth to our colleagues.\n- Transparency: We prioritize transparency as a core principle of success by communicating clearly and providing all the information we need to be successful.\n- Teamwork: We work in total alignment and support each other to make a positive impact.\n- Empathy: We are empathetic, prioritize each other, and show kindness by listening intently, being sincere, and creating a safe work environment for each other.\n- Excellence: We are a successful business by showing up and completing our best work every day.\nStep 4: An assessment on how to write core values – did you get it right?\nAs you write core values statements, it’s helpful to run through this checklist to ensure each values statement aligns with the behaviors you expect to see from your organization. Here are a few helpful questions to consider to evaluate the quality of your core values statements:\n- Is this value a non-negotiable? Is it critical to the culture and success of your organization?\n- Are these your guiding principles, and how you expect your team to behave?\n- Is the behavior you wish to see expressed in your values statement?\n- Are you willing to stand by these values, even if it means losing an employee or customer?\nIt would also be a great idea to gather input from your organization. For example, especially in the initial phases of your strategic planning process, you might send out a survey with questions for each value, such as, “What does it look like when we are behaving with this core value?” and “How do we put this core value to use?” These can yield insightful ideas about your values and cement your team’s commitment to your core values.\nPro Tip:\nWe recommend a core values list of five to seven values. Keeping this list relatively short helps these values really stand out. Your core company values are principles you cannot or will not negotiate or compromise. They are unique to your organization, not something that sounds nice but could just as easily be copied and pasted into another organization.\n3 Examples of Effective Core Values in Action\nEvery company has a different set of values and ways they deploy them in their organization. Here are three simple of examples of companies that are using values for the empowerment of their teams:\n- Google’s core value of innovation can be seen in its continuous development of innovative products, pushing beyond the status quo.\n- Patagonia’s emphasis on sustainability is showcased through its eco-friendly business practices, which align with its core values and make a positive impact on the environment.\n- OnStrategy’s core principle of excellence is reflected in its dedication to providing top-notch consulting services. We always strive for the best work in every project we deliver.\nNeed help weaving core values and company culture together? Check out this helpful post for 11 tips for communicating your core values.\nYou also want to be intentional about creating experiences with your core values. Then, as you live your values consistently and intentionally, you will help to create a values-centered culture. And remember, the culture is what changes the game when it comes to organizational strategy.\nCore Value FAQs\nCheck out our examples of core values list here!\nThe difference between company core values and personal values is for whom they serve. Obviously, personal values only serve an individual. Company values have a direct impact on a company culture and how you expect a group of people to behave, where personal value only guide the personal development of an individual.\nAnother key difference is that multiple people can influence core values and development in an organization. In any planning process, it is important to gather the common core values shared among your team and unite them to help create your company’s identify and behavior expectations.",

    "content": "How do you know when to hold team meetings? It's a difficult question. If you hold them too often, team members will see them as an inefficient burden on their time, get bored, and stop engaging.\nAccording to BetterMeetings, 78% of people surveyed feel that their meeting schedule is either always or sometimes out of control.\nHowever, if you don't hold meetings often enough, your team objectives can get off track and your results could suffer from lack of brainstorming and collaboration. Remote team members could also start feeling isolated and disconnected, which can damage their morale\nDeciding on the perfect meeting cadence for your remote team is essential to balance the line between not meeting enough and meeting \"all the time.\"\nTo achieve an effective team meeting cadence, meeting leaders need to understand how to set a cadence, refine the meeting cadence over time, and use collaboration tools to increase meeting efficiency and hold better meetings.\nWhat is a meeting cadence?\nA meeting cadence simply refers to the number of meetings you have, when you have them, and how long they are.\nYour meeting cadence can be bi-weekly, weekly, bi-monthly, monthly, or quarterly. Following a bi-monthly meeting cadence, for example, means your team meets twice a month.\nThe concept of a meeting cadence is important for running successful meetings because the right meeting cadence can increase productivity and team effectiveness. Meeting too often or not enough can sabotage your team's success, and hinder its ability to make decisions and put project management initiatives in place.\nImportant questions to ask before you set your meeting cadence\nDon't just automatically decide that weekly team meetings or monthly meetings are the best cadence for your team. There are several considerations to take into account when trying to establish the right cadence.\nHere are a few questions that managers can use when trying to build a meeting cadence strategy:\n- \"What is the goal of this meeting?\" Depending on the objective, you may need to meet more often, or not as much.\n- \"Can this meeting happen asynchronously?\" Do you need to meet in person, on Zoom, or will another channel like email or Slack be the best option?\n- \"Is this a high-priority or urgent task?\" If there's a deadline approaching, or a critical project on the books, a more frequent meeting cadence may be necessary.\n- \"Do these types of meetings regularly run over the allotted time?\" If so, it may be more effective to meet more often.\n- \"Do we run out of items to discuss in these types of meetings?\" A lean or empty meeting schedule may be a sign that you're meeting more often than necessary.\n- \"Do we often run out of time discussing action items in these meetings?\" If you never have enough time or don't get to the bottom of your meeting agenda, you need to meet more often.\n- \"How many people will attend these meetings?\" If there are several people attending, your meetings may be more effective if you break them up into smaller meetings with fewer people.\nHow to select a meeting cadence\nDeciding on the right meeting cadence depends on the type of meeting you're conducting.\nTeam leaders must consider the meeting attendees, the meeting facilitator, the topic that you'll be covering, and your company. Every business is unique and what's best for one may not work well for another.\nBe aware you may not find your perfect meeting rhythm right away, so don't lock yourself into a meeting cadence forever.\nTake a transparent, proactive approach with your team, and announce that you will try a new meeting cadence for a while â and if it doesnât work, you can revisit it in the future.\nConsider the type of meeting youâre running when choosing a cadence\nThe category of meeting cadence depends on what you want the meeting to accomplish. Here are some of the most common cadences to choose from:\nDaily meetings\nDaily meetings work well for check-ins, to update team members on pending tasks, and discuss the obstacles blocking their progress.\nMeetings that fall under this category are:\n- Daily standup meetings: They are so short, team members don't even need to sit down. These can also be called a âdaily huddle.â The point of these meetings is to quickly run through everyone's tasks for the day. Stand-up meetings should last no more than 20 minutes.\n- Team check-ins: A daily check-in are async updates that can be done directly in Range. These will let everyone know what you're working on that day, and what you may need help with. There are also mood check-ins and questions to get the whole team talking. Takes about 5 minutes!\nWeekly meetings\nA weekly meeting cadence is helpful for getting the team together to review the last weekâs progress, and to go over what's on tap for the upcoming week. They're typically held on the same day at the same time every week.\nMeetings that fall under this category are:\n- Department team meetings: Each team member can address their hotlist, give status updates, or discuss any bottlenecks they are experiencing. These can last anywhere from one to two hours.\n- One-on-one meetings: Meetings don't have to have a dozen people. Some only have two! The one-on-one meeting cadence is a weekly meeting between the team leader and their direct report(s). During this meeting, the direct report shares specific information about the projects theyâre working on, and managers provide feedback, insights, and guidance. These meetings are doubly valuable for remote team members, who typically donât get much synchronous face time with their managers. One-on-ones are typically less than an hour long.\nâï¸ Keep your meeting history and notes in one place.\nâ¡ï¸ Try a meeting template in Range.\nMonthly meetings\nSome examples of monthly meetings are:\n- All-hands meetings: Everyone in the company joins this monthly meeting to share updates and hear announcements. Upcoming changes or shifts in company policies are typically announced at all-hands meetings. Plan to set aside about two hours for these meetings\n- Leadership meetings: The leadership team, which is made up of managers from each department, meets once a month. These meetings take place on a recurring schedule, usually on the same day and time. If managers have been buried in their own departments, this is a chance to get updated on other facets of the business. There's a critical exchange of information during these meetings, which typically last anywhere from two to four hours.\nQuarterly meetings\nCertain topics are best discussed less often â quarterly meetings work well in these scenarios. Some examples of good quarterly meetings are:\n- Board meetings: There's no reason to take up board members' time with a weekly, or even monthly, meeting cadence. Set these meetings up four times a year to update the board on high-level initiatives, investments, and changes. These meetings can last anywhere from three hours to a full day.\n- Business reviews: It's smart to keep an eye on where the business is in relation to sales goals. This meeting allows the stakeholders to review new accounts, sales by product, and efforts to increase sales, ranging from marketing efforts to customer support. This meeting should last about half a day.\nAdditional meeting cadence tips\nNow that youâve established what schedule is ideal for the type of meeting youâre planning, what else can you do to make sure the new routine is as successful as possible?\nHere are a few additional meeting cadence tips to make sure the right people are there, your agenda is prepared, and your communication is on point.\nInvite the right teammates\nSometimes, it feels easier to just invite people you're on the fence about, even if it hinders the meeting's effectiveness. Avoid this pitfall.\nOnly invite the necessary parties to your meeting, then afterward send the meeting notes to anyone else who needs to be privy to the information. This gives the uninvited people more time in their workday and reduces the chance that the meeting will dissolve into ineffective tangents.\nPrepare your agenda in advance\nâWinging itâ may seem like you're leaving room for spirited debate and bouts of creativity, but you're actually setting yourself â and your team â up for failure. Use an agenda template and carefully map out the meeting topics from beginning to end. If you want to include creative time, add it to the agenda.\nUse Range to create a meeting agenda and send it to all the attendees so they will know what to expect during the meeting, and can come prepared with questions or updates.\nConsider team size\nIf your team is small, it's easy to have a daily huddle. Circumstances may change if you have a team of a dozen people or more. Think about your team size as you plan your meeting cadence. While nobody loves long meetings, you need to carve out adequate time to hear out your team membersâ needs and obstacles â and give everyone a chance to participate.\nConsult your team to refine your meeting cadences\nRecurring meeting cadences help team members stay on track and frees up time in their schedules to focus on work.\n- By setting the date, time, and length of the meeting upfront, the attendees can plan around it effectively.\n- Be consistent with meetings but also provide the freedom to adjust and refine meeting cadences to better suit your team.\n- If there are other meetings that overlap with yours, or big project deadlines on meeting day, it pays to be flexible and deviate from the schedule that day.\n- Keep a pulse on your attendees' needs, and be willing to accommodate them.\nFlexibility is key â donât get too caught up in sticking to your agenda right down to the second. Things come up: Maybe the location of the meeting needs to change from in-person to via Zoom.\nOr, perhaps a meeting runs overtime due to a lengthy but productive brainstorming session. It may even be cut short if you and your team members run through agenda items quickly.\nRead the room to get a feel for whether or not your team members find the meeting to be useful, and donât be afraid to adjust accordingly.\nRemember, the goal of your meetings should always be to benefit your team members and the company overall. If you implement a new meeting cadence and meetings seem ineffective, lack engagement, or don't offer actionable plans, consider cutting the cadence down to fewer meetings.\nWhat about asynchronous communication?\nAsynchronous communication is different from real-time meetings, but they can still achieve the same objective. The above meeting cadence strategies apply to asynchronous communication just as much as synchronous communication.\nOne major benefit of asynchronous communication is that attendees have the flexibility of participating around their schedules â not the other way around (which is necessary for synchronous meetings).\nEstablishing a cadence for asynchronous communication is similar to establishing one for face-to-face meetings.\nWith Range check-ins, your team can:\n- Have fewer meetings with async check-ins and waste less time\n- Reduce meeting load by keeping every team member informed and connected\n- Easily share your work plan and what you accomplished\n- Check-in on a personal level and stay in-the-know âÂ from wherever.\n- Integrate tools from across your workflow, including Github, Google Docs, Google calendar, and more\n- Add tasks from your project management tools\n- Share updates via Slack or Microsoft Teams\nChange your strategy for asynchronous and synchronous meetings\nItâs important not to paint all your meetings with the same brush, as synchronous and asynchronous meetings require slightly different approaches.\nSynchronous, in-person meetings are excellent for information-seeking sessions. This includes project kick-offs and one-on-ones, where direct input from team members is highly valuable to the process.\nAsynchronous meetings are better suited for information-giving meetings, such as project updates, daily stand-ups, and check-ins.\nThe synchronous format may work better for quick sharing, while the asynchronous format might be more beneficial for in-depth, long-term collaboration. Again, it pays to think about what you're trying to accomplish, and then decide which format best suits that goal.\nMeeting management tools help you host fewer, better meetings\nBy automating your stand-up and check-in meeting cadences, meeting management tools like Range can free up your attendees' schedules while still providing all the benefits of a face-to-face meeting. Over time, these cadences will become second nature for both on-site and remote team members.\nMeeting management software make it easier for team members to engage when itâs convenient for them.\nAs a manager, tools like Range give you access to team communications, meeting notes, and task follow-ups all in one place.\nThis gives you better insights into what your team is working on, and what each person has on their plate. Similarly, team members have one-touch access to you and their coworkers, so itâs easy to fire off a question to someone via a chat feature and get a written response that they can refer to later.\nReady to find the perfect meeting cadence for your team?\nFiguring out the meeting cadence that's right for your team can be challenging. By planning it thoughtfully and keeping what you want to accomplish at the top of your mind, you can lay out a cadence that doesn't take up too much time, includes the right attendees, stays on track, effectively shares communication, and pushes projects forward.\nA good meeting cadence keeps team members updated and focused on their goals, helps pinpoint and overcome obstacles, and provides a way for them to feel included as part of the team.",

Let’s find out.\nSandler pain funnel — what’s the point?\nRather than focusing on selling your solution, the Sandler pain funnel forces you to focus on building a relationship with the buyer , and uncovering their biggest challenges.\nIt’s a more consultative style of selling, better suited to longer sales cycles with high level decision-makers. When you use the Sandler pain funnel with potential buyers, you position yourself as a trusted advisor rather than “just” a salesperson.\nMore than that, though, you force customers to confront their truest pain point, something they may not have really dug that deep into.\nThis part of the process is the key to the Sandler sales methodology to uncover pain points that you can use to guide the rest of the sales process .\nHow the Sandler pain funnel works\nThe Sandler pain funnel is a series of open-ended questions that gradually get more specific.\nSo, you’ve got to start broad.\nA few questions to kick off the pain conversation might be:\n- What is your goal for [Operational area] this [Year/Quarter/Month]?\n- How are you currently tracking against [Business goal]?\n- Do you mind if I spend a few minutes getting a better understanding of your business?\n- What are you focused on as a business right now?\n- What were you hoping to accomplish during today’s call?\nHere, we’re looking for our buyer to give us an indication of a pain point. We want to know, “Why is it that we’re talking today?”\nOnce you identify a specific pain point, ask:\n- Can you walk me through [Operational area] process from [first step] to [business outcome]?\n- Can you be more specific? Maybe give me an example.\n- Why do you suppose this is happening?\n- How long has that been a problem?\nThese are surface problem questions. Next, we’re going to dive into impacts:\n- What is the impact of this problem on your company?\n- What does that look like in dollar terms?\n- What have you already tried to solve this problem? How has that worked?\n- How effective is your current solution, on a scale of 1-5?\nNotice how we’re developing the pain. We’ve brought it to the surface, then started to look at business impacts. Finally, we’ll dig into the emotional ramifications of the pain point:\n- Does your current solution produce any bottlenecks? Who is impacted?\n- What happens if we don’t address this [Pain/challenge] now?\n- Have you given up trying to deal with this problem?\nSandler pain funnel sample questions\nLet’s explore a few pain questions you can use in your own customer interviews.\nRemember, the idea with the Sandler pain funnel is to gradually progress from broad questions to more narrow ones, so some of these questions will only be relevant further on in the process.\nNeed more examples? Get these 28 Sandler pain funnel questions . They’ll sharpen your Sandler skills and boost sales methodology adoption.\nSandler pain funnel example call transcript\nThe Sandler pain funnel is not a series of specific questions that sales reps must use in each and every call. Instead, you should adapt your approach to each prospect and their current situation.\nWhile the example below is pure fiction, you can use it to guide your own sales conversations and as a framework to follow.\nSales rep:Brian, do you mind if I confirm a few items about your organization before we get started?\nBuyer:Sure.\nSales rep:Great. How big is your team? How many employees are you looking to provision with NumberOneSalesCRM?\nBuyer:We’re currently a team of 14. 7 SDRs, 4 Account Executives, and myself, the Sales Manager. But we have plans to double that headcount in the next 12 months.\nSales rep:Wow, that’s an ambitious goal, I love it. So what prompted you to evaluate a solution like NumberOneSalesCRM? When are you looking to start using the new CRM for your sales efforts?\nBuyer:Because of those growth plans, we really need a better way to manage the sales pipeline. So we’re looking for a solution more or less immediately.\nSales rep:Of course. Okay, so most of our customers are currently using NumberOneSalesCRM to manage inbound sales leads from initial contact through to close. Can you tell me a little more about your sales process?\nBuyer:Sure, so right now, we operate on an inbound model also, but if I’m being really honest with you, we don’t have a super-strong process. Once a new lead comes in, one of the salespeople picks it up from a email inbox, calls them, and takes it from there.\nSales rep:That makes sense. How do you feel about that process as it stands today?\nBuyer:I know we’ve got a lot of room for improvement. We’ve got a somewhat rigid process we’ve been trying to implement, but it’s been difficult to manage.\nSales rep:Difficult to manage? Tell me more about that.\nBuyer:Well yeah, because I don’t have any visibility on what my reps are doing. I don’treallyknow what activities they’re running at each stage, how often they’re chasing up leads, or if they’re even following that sales process.\nSales rep:Hmm. I can imagine that’s quite frustrating?\nBuyer:Yeah, it is a little.\nSales rep:How long has this been a problem?\nBuyer:For the last year, I’say, since we’ve been scaling the sales team.\nSales rep:I see. What kind of impact would you say that’s having on your business?\nBuyer:I’m sure it’s preventing us from making a few sales, though I really have no way to quantify that right now. But for sure, it’s stopping me from being able to properly report on performance to my CEO and manage my sales team effectively.\nSales rep:Of course. And what does that mean for you, not having that ability?\nBuyer:Well, it doesn’t feel good, let’s put it that way. It makes one-on-ones with my boss pretty difficult. Plus, for our sellers this lack of visibility means they sometimes lose deals they otherwise might have won — causing some of our top sales talent to leave the company.\nSales rep:Oh wow. So it’s not only having a huge impact on business performance and on your job directly, but it’s also preventing you from retaining key members of your team. How do you feel about that?\nBuyer:Not super happy, now that I really think about it.\nAfter the Sandler pain funnel: What’s next?\nFeel like that last example left you hanging a little bit?\nThat’s because it kind of does. The Sandler pain funnel, remember, is only one part of the Sandler Selling System.\nSo, what’s next? How do you transition out of the pain funnel and into the next stage?\nFirst, review and recap the conversation you’ve just had. Summarize (using the prospect’s own words) to show that you understand their situation. For example:\nSales rep:So, if I can just confirm that I understand correctly? As it stands today, you’ve got no CRM solution, and you’re handling lead management pretty manually. As a result, sales processes aren’t being followed, you’ve got little visibility on sales team performance, and to make matters worse, key members of your sales team are leaving. Is that correct?\nThe answer from your customer should be a resounding yes. If not, you’ve got more digging to do (you haven’t uncovered the true pain yet).\nWith the recap complete and confirmed, we now seek commitment to change and ask for permission to move the conversation toward a solution:\nSales rep:So tell me, Brian, if we were able to put together a solution that gave you that visibility and insight into rep performance, so you could provide development opportunities where required, and both grow your team and retain them, how motivated would you be to put something like that in play?\nCustomer:Very.\nSales rep:Great, how about we explore some potential solutions together?\nEasy, right?\nFor more information on budget, decision, and other closing parts of the system, read our in-depth guide to the entire Sandler Selling method .\nFrame these Sandler questions on the walls of your sales floor\nThese 28 Sandler pain funnel questions cover everything you need to:\nDrive higher adherence to Sandler on your team\nSteal top performers’ sales questions backed by data\nUnderstand how to successfully implement the framework on your team\nThe pain funnel questions are yours FOR FREE.

    "content": "Run a Team Meeting with KPIs\nGeneral company updates or things they need to know are great to share with employees before the meeting. Then allocate a few minutes for any questions from the team about those topics. If your team meeting involves multiple departments, this is a great way to get information from them ahead of time instead of spending the first 20 minutes of your meeting getting updates from everyone. Everyone should have audio and video when working from home to get more team collaboration.\nRun a Team Meeting Where Making Decisions Makes Meetings Effective\nIt is hard for employees to know their roles in a meeting when it comes to decisions. Are they there to listen? Are they to provide input? Do you want to make this decision by consensus? Be sure to make clear in these scenarios who is ultimately responsible for making the decision and ensuring you have the team's support for the decisions being made and implemented. The purpose of a staff meeting is to solve problems, not create more of them, so solve everything you can while you are together as a team. Ensure that all action items are recorded and assigned to the proper employee.\nRun a Team Meeting with an Agenda\nIf you have a big project to discuss, don't leave it for the last five minutes of your meeting. If a conversation goes on too long, see what can be redirected to the next session or set a time to follow up on that topic after the team meeting. The weekly meeting facilitator will have to make some judgment calls in real-time as to whether it is worth continuing the discussion, getting it back on track, or tabling it. Individual team members should have the chance to participate in each agenda item that is relevant to them. The person taking the meeting minutes is often the best person to nudge the meeting back on track.\nPrepare for the Team Meeting\nA successful team meeting will have a leader who can facilitate the conversation, but that leader doesn't have to run the entire session. Once you've determined your agenda topics and meeting schedule, could you let your team know if they need to prepare to share information in advance? This is a fantastic opportunity to give team members a chance to lead discussions, share important updates, offer suggestions, and come away with action items for the next meeting. Still, they can only do that if they're prepared. Only spring a topic on them at the forum if you want a productive discussion. Feel free to bring any additional insight from your skip-level meeting questions.\nGet Better at Each Weekly Team Meeting.\nSeek feedback from your team on your meeting agenda. What worked well and what didn't? You can use that information to tweak your agenda to what works best for the team and their needs. This continuous feedback loop will ensure that your weekly team meetings get better each week. In work-from-home and remote teams, you should avoid conference calls when possible and use web conferencing software like Microsoft Teams or Zoom. Make sure that you start the meeting on time, clearly explain the purpose of the meeting, and get better each week. Pretty soon your bad meetings, turn into tolerable ones and eventually great meetings.\nA team meeting should be something the employees look forward to each week — a place where they can share their concerns, share ideas, ask questions, get valuable information, and feel that they are part of the overall process. 80% of your weekly meetings should be spent solving problems. Here is how to fix weekly meetings. Take some time to craft your agenda to make the most of that weekly team meeting slot and treat it as a weekly team-building exercise rather than something you just have to survive!\nIf you want to run the perfect executive team meeting, read this post, our check our learn section to learn more about the multiple types of meetings.\nNeed help getting your team aligned to achieve your growth goals?

    "title": "What Are Great Core Values? — PFD Group",
    "domain": "pfd-group.com",
    "age": "1,208 days ago",
    "content": "One of the first questions clients of PFD Group ask us is what are great core values?\nIt’s a question that’s difficult to answer because core values are only as great as a company’s ability to fully live and deploy them.\nMaking the definition of “great” even more complicated is that each company is or should be wholly unique from any other business. So should their core values. Even two companies who share the exact same stated values should have very different approaches to why those values are the guiding ones and how each business uses those values to guide their daily decisions.\nThe more unique your company is, the more your core values will define that uniqueness and the better culture you’ll have.\nGetting Started in Defining Your Values\nIf you’re in the early phases of building your business, selecting your core values can be the most important task at hand. Your values will define your company, define how you do business, guide how you select and manage your employees, and even define how your customers will do business with you.\nMost importantly, your core values are exactly that: core. They should not change to match current trends or shifts in consumer sentiment. These are the values you set in place that will guide you year after year, no matter what.\nIf your core values are already in place, only extenuating circumstances should drive their change. While the below examples may help you relook at how you share your values with your employees and customers, they below should not serve as inspiration for change.\nIf you’re new to building core values, the below should serve only as inspiration, and not, obviously, text to be copied. Build your own core values to reflect your unique business and your own personal values.\n50+ Core Values\nTo get you started, an infographic published by Visual Capitalist in tandem with research from Valuegraphics showcases the top 56 global values with a breakdown of importance by region. The top five globally are family, relationships, financial security, belonging and community.\nAnother list of possible core values and an excellent breakdown of how often each is used can be found in a study published by MIT Management Review, When It Comes to Culture, Does Your Company Walk the Talk?\nThe survey lists 62 values that are used by at least 1% of companies that have publicly defined their formal values statements.\nA Word About Integrity\nOn the MIT chart, “integrity” clearly and significantly outpaces all other values with 65 percent of the 562 businesses audited listing “integrity” as a core value.\nNotwithstanding that Enron and Wells Fargo, both deemed some of America’s worst “bad corporate actors” list integrity among their core values, integrity has grown to be a term that is so loosely defined that it has become nearly a cliche.\nIf you choose to follow the crowd and adopt integrity as a core value, be sure to fully define exactly what that means for your business. Also note that none of PFD Group examples below list integrity as a guiding principle, despite the fact that they are all well-known, respected businesses.\nWhat Makes a Great Core Value?\nSo back to the original question. What makes a great core value?\nThe best core values are the ones that shine through in all you do and the ones that set your company apart. They are the values that are wholeheartedly believed and experienced by your leadership, your employees, your partners and your customers.\nFor core values to make a difference, you need to talk about them all the time. You have to live by them all the time. You need to hire, fire, discipline, and promote by them.\n–Scott Rritzheimer, Scale Architects\nBusiness Core Values\nHere are just a few companies who are actively achieving their defined core values.\nAirbnb Core Values\nChampion the Mission: We’re united with our community to create a world where anyone can belong anywhere.\nChampion the Mission\nBe a Host\nEmbrace the Adventure\nBe a Cereal Entrepreneur\nEtsy Core Values\nEtsy guiding principles include:\nWe commit to our craft.\nWe minimize waste.\nWe embrace differences.\nWe dig deeper.\nWe lead with optimism\nG Adventures\nThe core values of G Adventures are Love, Lead, Embrace, Create, Do.\nWe LOVE Changing People’s Lives\nLEAD with Service\nEMBRACE the Bizarre\nCREATE Happiness & Community\nDO the Right Thing\nCB Insights\nHelp us solve the biggest challenges in tech. Hungry. Humble. Helpful. Hard-working. High standards. We’ve built our company with these values—and we’re growing faster than ever.\nMotley Fool\nAt The Motley Fool, our highest priority is to foster inclusion and belonging so all employees can thrive both personally and professionally. We believe diverse teams perform better. From our board of directors to our recruiting pipeline, we strive for diversity, both inherent and acquired.\nMotley: Foster inclusion and belonging.\nCollaborative: Do great things together.\nInnovative: Search for a better solution.

This, we believe, is why we all give our very best in everything we do – and why we are known as one of the world’s top hotel companies, achieving countless accolades such as the renowned Forbes five-star ratings and being voted as either the top hotel, or in the top three, on TripAdvisor in every single location.\nVans\nTo us, “Off The Wall” is a state of mind. It means thinking differently and embracing creative self-expression. It’s choosing your own line on your board and in your life. Vans has over 50 years of connecting to youth culture and we continue to advocate for action sports while recognizing the global “Off The Wall” connection between our brand and art, music, and street culture enthusiasts.\nWe are DETERMINED — we have the Van Doren spirit. We’re scrappy and resourceful. We use ingenuity to tackle every challenge head on and find a path forward, even if it’s not a straight line.\nWe are CONNECTED — culturally, digitally, socially. We build lasting and meaningful relationships with our consumers, customers, partners and family, wherever they might be.\nWe are INCLUSIVE — We invite unique perspectives and value different experiences. We want to hear each other’s point of view.\nWe are vibrant and EXPRESSIVE in how we speak, interact and get our jobs done.\nWe have FUN working at Vans because we work hard and play hard in our pursuit of enabling creative expression.\nIf you need help creating your core values or ensuring your corporate culture is actively adopting and performing against those values, the PFD Group can help.

Theyâre a tried and true method thatâs been around since the 70s, and has revolutionized the way companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple do business.\nWhile there are plenty of other goal-setting methodologies out there, OKRs remain fan favorite for good reason.\nâOKRs have helped lead us to 10x growth, many times over. They've helped make our crazily bold mission of \"organizing the world's information\" perhaps even achievable. They've kept me and the rest of the company on time and on track when it mattered the most.\" â Larry Page, former CEO of Alphabet and co-founder of Google\nDone right, they can bring unprecedented levels of innovation and growth to your team too.\nIn this article, weâll dig into everything you need to know about OKRs and share real-life OKR examples for all types of teams to get you started on your own journey.\nWhat are OKRs?\nOKRs are a goal-setting methodology created by Intel leader Andy Grove and championed by his mentee John Doerr.\nThe O stands for objective and the KR stands for key results. OKRs can be used by companies, teams, and individuals to drive ambitious outcomes with greater focus.\nOKRs help teams:\n- Align on whatâs most important\n- Rally behind a small set of carefully chosen priorities\n- Set measurable milestones for how to achieve goals\n- Track progress and know when to shift gears\n- Build greater autonomy, ownership, and accountability\n- Innovate more than the competition\nWho should use OKRs?\nGrove created OKRs after observing that teams do their best work when theyâre focused on driving specific resultsânot endless busywork. Theyâre meant to be for everyone within an org, from CEO to intern.\nTheyâre especially powerful at companies focused on growth, who are looking for new ways to innovate, outshine competitors, and execute more efficiently.\nâAs a company, as a business, as entrepreneurs, we need to be focused on the outcomes we want, what we can learn, and what changes we can make to succeed.â âÂ Mike Wu, former CTO, VSCO\nHow do OKRs work?\nOKRs represent your company or teamâs focus, not the totality of work. Theyâre a guide used to direct effort.\nAt the most basic level, hereâs how the framework looks in action.\n- Objective: What you want to accomplish\n- Key results: 3-5 measurable ways youâre going to get there\nTo write effective OKRs, itâs important to understand how each of these components works on a slightly deeper level.\nThe objective\nObjectives are the high-level goals youâre trying to achieve. Theyâre typically anchored to your organizationâs values and mission, and help provide focus and guidance as to what top-level priorities are at any given time.\nStrong objectives are:\n- Moonshot goals that are bold and aspirational (success shouldnât be a given)\n- Action-oriented and concrete\n- Few in number, think 5 or less\nSome examples of objectives:\n- Increase international customer base\n- Increase recurring revenue\n- Scale system performance\n- Foster a more inclusive company culture\n- Improve cross-team communication\nâOKRs are really ambitious. They're things that are not easy to achieve. They're not sales targets. They're not quotas. They're big, hairy, audacious things that you want to force everyone to aim for, knowing that it's outside their comfort range.â â Ken Norton, Senior Operating Partner at GV (formerly Google Ventures)\nThe key results\nEach objective should have 3-5 key results. These are your milestones and benchmarksâthey explain how youâll work towards your moonshot objective with clear, measurable outcomes. Each key result should have one designated owner responsible for its delivery.\nStrong key results are:\n- Critical to the success of your objective\n- Aggressive, but achievable\n- Measurable and time boundâyour time frame can either be written into the result itself or implied based on how often you review results (i.e. quarterly)\n- Black and whiteâyou either meet the requirements for success or you donât\nSome examples of key results:\n- Increase checkout flow conversions by 40%\n- Attend 3 networking events this quarter\n- Write and publish 1 blog post per week\n- Present research findings at Q3 company all-hands\n- Build 5 email templates for the marketing team\nOKR dos and donâts\nHere are a few more guidelines to get the most out of your OKRs.\n- â Keep it simple: Experts say organizations should have a maximum of 5 objectives with 3-5 key results each\n- â Keep it short: Each objective and key result should fit on one line\n- â Be aspirational: Your objectives should represent a moon shot or âNorth Starâ, not something you know you can achieve\n- â Be overly prescriptive: OKRs should lay out the âwhatâ and âwhyâ, but not the âhow.â Execution is up for teams and individuals to decide\n- â Include everything: OKRs are not an exhaustive to-do list or product roadmap âÂ theyâre meant to define success at the highest level, not every single activity\nâ[OKRs] requires a kind of rigor and discipline about saying these are the most important things that are going on in the organization. Itâs not the sum total of tasks. Itâs not the work order for the enterprise. Itâs whatever we as a team agree deserves special attention, and it really matters.âÂ â John Doerr, Harvard Business Review\nAre OKRs for teams or individuals?\nShort answer: both. But depending on different factors within your team or company, you might structure things a bit differently.\nHere are two examples of how that might look.\nCascading OKRs example\nWith cascading OKRs, the company sets its OKRs first. The KRs from the company-level objectives then become team-level objectives, and the KRs from the team-level objectives become individual objectives. This approach is helpful because it puts someone on the hook at every levelâand prevents duplicative work. It's a common approach at larger companies.\nCompany\nObjective: Become the leading travel booking company in the world\n- Key result: Increase booking conversions from 35% to 50%\n- Key result: Increase brand visibility by 50%\n- Key result: Achieve an NPS score of 65\n- Key result: Open 2 international offices this year\nProduct team\nObjective: Increase booking conversions from 35% to 50%\n- KR: Launch new mobile app by Q3\n- KR: Conduct user research in 3 target markets\n- KR: Decrease latency by 50%\nProduct researcher\nObjective: Conduct user research in 3 target markets\n- KR: Hold UserTesting sessions with 50 users\n- KR: Conduct in-person interviews with 15 users\n- KR: Present findings at July All-hands\nTop-down, bottoms up OKR example\nWith the top-down, bottoms-up approachâOKRs are set at the company level and shared so the whole team knows top-level priorities. Individuals and teams also create their own OKRs with this approach, but they donât have to ladder up quite so strictly.\nWhen team members can see the goals and key results they should be shooting for, they can be more creative about how they go about achieving results.\nCompany\nObjective: Become the leading travel booking company in the world\n- KR: Get 500,000 new bookings\n- KR: Increase brand visibility by 50%\n- KR: Achieve an NPS score of 65\n- KR: Open 2 international offices this year\nIndividual\nObjective: Generate 50,000 new social media followers\n- KR: Launch partner campaign with 2 influencers\n- KR: Post on Twitter 3x per week\n- KR: Get exec leaders to share content on LinkedIn twice this quarter\nIn this example, the individual believes that increasing their social media following will have a positive impact on the company-level initiative related to brand visibility. Their OKR is shaped by the companyâs, but not directly cascaded from it.\nâHigh-functioning teams thrive on a creative tension between top-down and bottom-up goal setting, a mix of aligned and unaligned OKRs.â â John Doerr, Measure What Matters\nExample OKRs by team\nOKRs can help with alignment, focus, and execution at all kinds of companies and on any type of teams. They work well for personal goals too, and can even be used by teams and ICs to align when theyâre not used at the company-level.\nCompany OKR examples\nObjective: Grow annual recurring revenue (ARR)\n- KR: Generate $600,000 in new ARR\n- KR: Expand to 3 new markets\n- KR: Decrease churn by 40%\nObjective: Build a loyal customer base\n- KR: Launch a rewards program\n- KR: Reach an NPS score of 70\n- KR: Launch 4 new product features based on customer feedback\nProduct OKR examples\nObjective: Build a world-class product that users love\n- KR: Launch 2 new, competitive features\n- KR: Hire 3 user researchers to bring the user voice into our work\n- KR: Dedicate the whole team to a week long bug bash\nObjective: Launch new app update\n- KR: Design and build 2 new features\n- KR: Incorporate 3 learnings from user research\n- KR: Have less than 2 bugs per feature in QA\nSales OKR examples\nObjective: Hit our 2022 business target\n- KR: Close 20% of pipeline generated by opportunities\n- KR: Sell $200,000 in new business\nObjective: Generate pipeline\n- KR: Create 100 opportunities worth $1 million in ARR\n- KR: Send 1,000 cold emails\n- KR: Make 500 cold calls\nMarketing OKR examples\nObjective: Build positive brand awareness\n- KR: Hire social media and PR leads to promote our brand externally\n- KR: Launch partner campaigns with 3 related brands\n- KR: Land 2 guest posts in large news or blog outlets\nObjective: Launch a widely attended industry conference\n- KR: Secure budget and venue by Q1\n- KR: Recruit 4 external thought leaders to speak\n- KR: Launch ad campaign that reaches 3,000 potential attendees\nCustomer support OKR examples\nObjective: Decrease customer churn\n- KR: Build out a tailored support program for enterprise customers\n- KR: Kick-off monthly team trainings on new product features\n- KR: Interview 20 recently churned customers\nObjective: Expand support coverage to Hindi and Chinese\n- KR: Localize top 25 help center articles\n- KR: Hire 15 native speakers for each language for phone support\n- KR: Scope internal translation tool that would support both languages\nPersonal OKR examples\nObjective: Get promoted to a management position\n- KR: Mentor 2 summer interns\n- KR: Complete leadership training program\n- KR: Shadow a leader on the team 2x per month\nObjective: PR in the Chicago half marathon next year\n- KR: Run 5x week, 40 minutes minimum\n- KR: Strength train 2x week\n- KR: Decrease mile speed by 5 seconds each week\nâIf youâre at an early-stage company where you havenât yet found product-market fit, I recommend creating hypothesis OKRs. Write something you think might be true, set key results that will indicate if itâs true, and give it 6-12 weeks to prove or disprove.â â Christina Wodtke, author of Radical Focus and lecturer at Stanford University\nHow to set and follow-up on OKRs for your team\nMost teams set OKRs quarterly, but thatâs not a hard and fast rule. Annual OKRs or half OKRs (every 6 months) are also fairly common.\nNo matter your cadence, itâs important to kick off the process with a solid planning session. Here, youâll align on your top priorities (the objectives) and come up with key results at the team level.\nExample agenda for an OKR planning session\n- Set the scene: Overview of how the meeting will be structured and ground rules for participation.\n- Start with an icebreaker: Quick introductions and a team-building question to break the ice and get creative juices flowing.\nNo sign-up required\nTry our (free) icebreaker generator\nTake a spin! Start your next meeting with one of these icebreaker questions. It works the same way in Range.\n- Review your company mission: Ground yourselves in your company mission, vision, and any company-level OKRs to help guide brainstorm and discussion.\n- Set 3 objectives: Avoid getting overly bogged down in the details by focusing only on your objectives first.\n- Brainstorm: If your objectives arenât predetermined by a cascading system, start with a whole-team brainstorm on what your moon shot goals should be. Cast a wide netâthere are no right or wrong answers at this phase. Itâs all about capturing ideas.\n- Prioritize: Pick 3 objectives from your brainstorm that will become your teamâs top prioritiesâthis might necessitate discussion and debate, but itâs worth it as you make team-level commitments. Deciding what you wonât focus on together is just as important as deciding what you will.\n- Add key results: Next, for each objective, youâll hone in on 3-5 key results. The process will mirror what you did for objectivesâfirst brainstorm, then prioritize. For this phase, donât worry about adding specific numbers to your key results. Just use placeholders.\n- Decide on key result values: Once youâve prioritized your key results, look across everything youâve committed to and add realistic targets with the full set in mind.\n- Assign owners: Each objective and key result should have a clear owner responsible for its outcome. Thatâs not to say others wonât work on it throughout the quarter. Having a clear owner though makes sure someoneâs accountable when it comes to the end result.\n- Closing round: End with a check out round where everyone shares how theyâre feeling â this can be about the commitments made, the process, emotions, or anything else.\nâThe idea that people will throw up their arms and say âI tried, and I just canât write my OKRsâ is completely logical. Itâs normal and often the reality. Thereâs no shortcut. Youâre going to have to give OKRs the attention they deserve and invest in them.ââ Andrew Beebe, Managing Director, Obvious Ventures\nReview OKRs on a regular basis\nEstablishing a way to track progress toward your OKRs is critical to the process. Too often OKRs are created, then left in a spreadsheet to be checked on only at the end of the quarter. At this point, thereâs not much more to do than grade them and move on, which hinders the learning process.\nWhen it comes to actually making progress, connecting your OKRs to daily actions is key. According to Stanford psychologist Kelly McGonigal, taking small daily steps that are in line with your goals is one of the best (research-backed) ways to drive results over time.\nâï¸ Tracking your OKRs in a tool like Range helps keep them front and center every day, without adding unnecessary processes to the mix.\nâ¡ï¸ Try this OKR check-in meeting template.\nReflecting on progress at the end of a quarter or cycle is also crucial. Taking time to go through a retrospective, which includes grading your OKRs, will help you and your team improve how you write your goals and objectives, and how you identify the best metrics with which to measure key results.\nWhen you miss an OKR, hold yourself and your team accountable but donât focus on blaming. Address when this happens, uncover what can be learned, consider whether or not you set the right objective, and then work to achieve the clarity you need to achieve success in the next cycle.\nHow to master OKRs with Range\nWith Range Goals, OKRs are easier and more intuitive for teams to manage. Theyâre meant to help organizations avoid the âcreate and forgetâ trap, while also being simple to track so they become part of the regular cadence of communication.\nWhy teams use Range for OKRs\n- Simple, intuitive workflow to set up and update OKR progress regularly\n- Automatic reminders keep objective owners on top of regular status updates, and send them out to the right stakeholders via email or Slack\n- Daily check-ins provide focus, and keep OKRs and alignment top of mind\n- Automatically pull OKR status to your meeting agendas to keep everyone aligned with zero overhead\n- Hierarchical structure allows individual and team-level goals to ladder up into company goals seamlessly\nâï¸ No separate OKR spreadsheet or sending a goal update email\nâ¡ï¸ Range makes it easy for your team to make (and share) progress on goals while they work. Get started now.\nOKR FAQs\nWhatâs the difference between goals and OKRs?\nWell, it depends who you ask. There are many different frameworks out there for tracking team progress and outcomes âÂ OKRs are one of them. In the OKR framework, goals are broader and more long term than objectives. They give you the overarching direction for your business plan and define where you want to be in the future.\nThe right goal will align with your company vision, purpose, and long-term aspirations. You might use goals in your yearly and quarterly company strategy, in your positioning, mission statement, company culture guide, financial projections, and other crucial business documents and initiatives.\nA goal establishes a desired outcome. An individual company goal is a broad statement; it is large in size and intangible, so itâs harder to measure than an OKR.\nWhatâs the difference between OKRs and KPIs?\nKPI stands for key performance indicatorâtheyâre standalone metrics that measure the health of your business. OKRs help direct effort and work, while KPIs measure how youâre doing in one particular area. They can actually be complementary to OKRs, because KPIs typically make good key results.",

    "content": "In entrepreneurial circles, there's a lot of talk about the concepts of working \"in\" your business versus working \"on\" your business. The distinction is that working in the business defines the work that drives the business day to day - going to meetings, answering email, providing products and services for customers. Working on the business is the time you spend thinking about why the business exists, how it should operate and what it should become. Far too many entrepreneurs get caught up in working in their business, because there are few people to delegate important day-to-day work to, and neglect to focus their thinking in the other vital category - working on their business to make it better.\nI'd like to borrow this idea from the entrepreneurial community and turn our gaze to mid-sized and larger firms, and think about how much time, if any, companies spend on two critical aspects of their business: strategy and innovation. It seems to me that both of these functions lack both \"in\" and \"on\" engagement, leading to organizations that aren't quite sure of their direction and that have trouble creating interesting new product and services.\nI'll address both briefly below.\nIn Strategy or On Strategy?\nIt's far easier to talk about activities that are in the business (doing the day to day activities) versus on the business (thinking about the future, competitors, growth and change) than it is to talk about time in strategy versus on strategy. I'll provide a definition of what I mean by in strategy and on strategy.\nIn strategy is the work of executing a viable strategy, developing an organizational structure that reflects what the strategy is trying to achieve. Building processes and systems that enable and support the defined strategy. What's difficult working \"in strategy\" is that it appears to be a lot like \"in the business\" except that it is informed by a definitive strategy. You can imagine how easy it is to slip from working \"in strategy\" to \"in the day to day\" or becoming more reactive, since competition and market pressures are extreme and it is easy to forgot or ignore your stated strategy. That is, if you have a strategy.\nWorking \"On Strategy\" means taking time to think carefully about your competitive advantage, where you want to focus limited resources, asking why you believe you can win. Strategy is about understanding the market, understanding competitors and seeing emerging opportunities that you can serve. Working on strategy means putting aside the day to day and seeing beyond the immediate tasks. It means imagining the future and the new opportunities and challenges. It means coming up with a value proposition, market segmentation and clear differentiation, and then communicating the strategy to the team, so that they can understand it and act on it.\nMost organizations spend about 95% of their time in the business, hoping that the work they are doing is not reactive but is guided by strategy. In reality, most firms lack definitive strategy, and even those that have a good strategy often fail to communicate it effectively. Executives would do well to pay heed to Stephen Covey, and learn to both \"start with the end in mind\" - build strategy and to \"Sharpen the Saw\" - do the work that is needed before other work takes precedence.\nIn Innovation or On Innovation?\nInnovation is perhaps just as vital as strategy, and receives less attention. Working \"In Innovation\" means doing work that is meant to create new products or services, generating ideas, spotting new trends or needs. Most importantly, this work also entails converting ideas into products or services that are launched to consumers or the marketplace. There are often several breakdowns in the \"in innovation\" sequence: poor or lacking innovation methods or process, unclear direction about key opportunities or challenges to solve, no connection between idea generation and the product or service development process. Work goes on \"in innovation\" but much of it lacks good direction, does not have definitive methods or processes, skips key activities, does little exploration and has little chance of becoming new products or services, due to a lack of integration between the \"front end\" and the product or service development funnel.\nWorking \"On Innovation\" rarely happens. To work on innovation, companies and teams would need to define their approach to innovation, define goals, define working patterns and relationships, identify important innovation opportunities, customer challenges or emerging markets. To work on innovation, companies need to train employees and build bridges between front end discovery and product or service development funnels BEFORE ideas are generated.\nFar too much innovation effort is wasted because companies move directly into the activities of innovation without defining them, develop ideas that are not aligned to customer needs, solve problems that customers don't care about, and do not have the funds or means to develop and launch ideas. What I've described is both of failure of being \"On Innovation\" which leads to failures \"In Innovation\".\nWe need more time On Strategy and On Innovation\nIt's clear companies need to spend more time on strategy and on innovation. The countervailing argument to that is that the executives are stretched, time is compressed, markets are constantly changing. To leave working \"in the business\" for any period of time risks the very existence of the company.\nExecutives need to delegate day to day operations to their leadership and managers, and spend far more time thinking and acting on strategy and on innovation. The increasing pace of change will not slow down, competitors don't give day passes if you cannot keep up. Only by investing on strategy and on innovation will you be able to compete and perhaps even steal a march on your competitors.",

    "content": "Subscribe\nSubscribe to The Art & Science of Complex Sales\nBy Dave Brock\nContinuing my series “Things We Thought We Knew About Selling But Really Didn’t,” I want to talk about our Ideal Customers–or our ICP (Ideal Customer Profile.) We toss the term around casually, but when I look at too many pipelines or prospecting programs, the ICP is not discernible.\nWe have a tendency to try to sell to anyone. If someone has visited our website, if they are on a procured mailing list, if they fog a mirror, we try to engage them.\nIf our pipelines are lean, we cast a wider net. We relax our criteria, looking to engage different customers, anything that might produce a response. And over time, we cast wider and wider nets, producing fewer results.\nTo achieve our goals, we have to know our ICP and target the best fits!\nAs much as we might want to think, not everyone or every organization is a possible customer for what we sell. Even if you sell water, not everyone in the world is your customer (A client actually sells water and it’s fascinating to see their focus on defining and selling within their ICP.)\nIt starts with a deep understanding of our own company, strategy, and offerings. We have to, honestly, answer “What are the problems we are the best in the world at solving and what are the characteristics of the people/organizations that have those problems?”\nWe have to be honest with ourselves on in understanding both our capabilities and where we best fit. We have our past history to leverage–what types of customers have we had our best success with? Why have we been successful with them? Where have we failed–both losses in selling, but where have we had failures with customers that have bought, then chosen not to renew or have been very unhappy.\nWe have to develop very rich profiles of these organizations. If can’t be just, “Technology companies,” or “Financial Services,” or whatever.\n- In technology, is it software, electronic components, product oriented companies, services oriented companies, telecom/networking/cloud and so forth.\n- Are they very large, start-up, SMB?\n- Are they global, national, regional, local?\n- Are they high growth, stable, troubled?\n- Are they the leaders in their markets, are the middle players, are they laggards?\n- Are they innovators, fast followers, early growth, later, laggards in their markets?\n- What is their culture/behavioral style?\n- What is their attitude in working with vendors/suppliers?\nOnce we have developed the profile of the ideal companies/organizations, based on firmographics, demographics, behavioral graphics, we have to do the same thing based on the ideal people within the organization.\n- Who are the problem owners in the enterprise?\n- How does the problem impact them, how does the problem manifest itself to them and their teams?\n- What is the impact of their problem?\n- Who are their customers in the organization and how does the problem impact them?\n- When does it become urgent to them?\n- Where to they learn about new approaches?\n- What types of people/organizations do they pay attention to?\n- Where do they tend to show up (conferences, trade shows, social, etc.)?\n- How are they measured?\n- What impacts their success, how do we impact their success? … and it goes on…\nWhile these represent our target personas, we also have to have a behavioral alignment. What are the ideal behavioral styles of these target personas? While people may be in similar roles, their responsiveness to us will be driven by their behavioral style.\nOMG! That’s a lot of stuff! But this is critical to our success. We want to focus our efforts on those enterprises and individuals having the highest likelihood to be interested in the issues we help them address. We want to focus on those where we are most likely to be interested in talking/working with us?\nAny organization/individual outside this space is a waste of our time–and in trying to engage them, we are wasting their time! They may be a potentially great customer, but it’s highly unlikely they will be our customer.\nToo often, as sellers, we don’t understand this–at least deeply enough. Too often, we don’t take the time to do the research to make sure the prospect is in our ICP. We think we sell to technology companies and prospect anyone that seems to have the right role within a technology company. But the reality is that we are only relevant and successful in the technology companies that have certain characteristics. Or we prospect individuals in those companies that we can get to–not those that really care about what we do.\nHere’s where we use the ICP in the most powerful way. Look at these questions:\n- How do we most effectively fill our pipelines?\n- How do we increase our win rates and drive performance?\nSo while we fill our pipelines, we are filling them with garbage! People and organizations that have a very low likelihood of buying from us, ever! Filling our pipelines with the wrong opportunities lowers our win rate. And when we lower our win rate, we get into this endless conundrum of finding more opportunities to achieve our goals.\nToo often, our natural reaction to fixing pipelines is exactly opposite from that which actually drive healthier, higher quality pipelines.\nOften, I’m asked, “How do we increase our win rate?” Most people think I’m going to respond with something having to do with improving selling skills. But the fastest way to improve our win rate is to narrow our focus, within our current ICP!\nThink of the ICP as something that looks like a target–the bullseye are the very best within our ICP. But our ICP, also, includes some outer rings. But when we are struggling, the fastest way to improve our performance/win rate is to narrow our focus within our ICP! What if we focus only on our bulls eye? How does that impact our win rate–then what are the ripple through impacts on our overall pipeline dynamics. Increasing our win rate, means we need fewer opportunities in our qualified pipelines, which means we don’t have to prospect as many potential customers to fill our pipelines.\nThe fastest way to improve our win rate is to narrow our focus, within our current ICP!\nOur natural reactions in building pipelines and prospecting is to cast a wider net, trying to address many more, different people and customers–moving beyond our ICP. Rather than producing more opportunities and helping us achieve our goals, it does the opposite. It produces far lower quality opportunities, and adversely impacts our abilities to achieve our goals.\nIf we want to maximize our impact, if we want to achieve our goals (or overachieve them), we have to know our ICP and target those customers and enterprises that are the best fit!\nAfterword, I’m writing a series of posts on “Basic Selling Skills,” just to remind us what/why we do what we do.

    "domain": "strategicdiscipline.positioningsystems.com",
    "age": "1,230 days ago",
    "content": "This morning during our monthly meeting one of my client’s debated their Core Values. A year ago they completed them and after reading Patrick Lencioni’s book The Advantage, the owner determined that it would make sense to revisit them based on the definitions of Core Values that Patrick Lencioni had defined in this book.\nIn 1996 Harvard Business Review published an article, Building Your Company’s Vision, by Jim Collins and Jerry Porras, that explored a number of the principles from their book Built to Last, and specifically the fact that companies who enjoy enduring success have core values, a core purpose that remain fixed, while their business strategies and practices endlessly evolve and adapt to the changing world.\nA well-conceived vision they offered consisted of two major components: Core Ideology and Envisioned Future. Core Ideologies defines the enduring character of an organization. It’s the glue that holds an organization together as it grows. Core values are defined as a small set of timeless guiding principles, core values require no external justification; they are intrinsic value and importance to those inside the organization.\nWhile there is no universally right set of core values, they did offer guidelines including limiting your core values to a few, three to five. They also believe they should be an authentic, exhibiting characteristic that exists now within your organization. You do not create or set core ideology. You discover core ideology. You do not deduce it by looking at the external environment. You understand it by looking inside.\nThe Mars Group exercise designed to help you discover your Core Values is a good example of this. Imagine that you’ve been asked to re-create the very best attributes of your organization on another planet but you have seats on the rocket ship for only five to seven people. Whom should you send? Most likely, you’ll choose the people who have a gut-level understanding of your core values, the highest level of credibility with their peers, and the highest levels of competence.\nOther questions asked in the HBR article include:\n- If you awoke tomorrow morning with enough money to retire for the rest of your life, would you continue to live those core values?\n- Can you envision them being as valid for you 100 years from now as they are today?\n- Would you want to hold those core values, even if at some point one or more of them became a competitive disadvantage?\n- If you were to start a new organization tomorrow in a different line of work, what core values would you build into the new organization regardless of its industry?\nThe value of the last three questions goes to their enduring value. Core Values should not change.\nOne distinction that separates Collins and Porras from Patrick Lencioni’s The Advantage is their belief core ideology is to guide and inspire, not to differentiate.\nLencioni feels that the mistake those leaders made in following Collins and Porras’ Core Value principles was trying to be all things to all people, which led them to make their values statements as broad and inclusive as possible.\nHe sees within organizations different kinds of values; Aspirational Values, Permission-to-Play Values, and Accidental Values. We’ll explore these definitions in another blog. The importance here is to realize that these representation of Core Values are not “core.”\nLencioni agrees with Collins and Porras that they are few Core Values—just two or three—behavioral traits that are inherent in an organization. He also believes the first step is to identify the employees in the organization who already embody what is best about the company and to dissect them, answering what is true about those people that make them so admired by the leadership team. Those qualities form the initial pool of potential core values.\nHis next step is identify employees who, though talented, were or are no longer a good fit for the organization. It is the opposite of those annoying traits that provide yet another set of potential candidates for core values.\nFinally, leaders need to be honest about themselves and whether or not they embody the values in that pool.\nThe place where Lencioni’ differs with Collins and Porras is his distinction with Permission to Play Values. Here he asks, “The best way to differentiate them is to ask, Would our organization be able to credibly claim that we are more committed to this value than 99 percent of the companies in our industry? If so, then maybe it really is core. If not, then it’s probably a candidate for permission-to-play; it’s still important and should be used as a filter in hiring, but it’s not what sets the organization apart and uniquely defines it.”\nMy client today noted the distinction that Lencioni offers. It doesn’t mean you are 99% more likely to have this value than your competition, but rather that you are 99% more committed to it than your competition. This brings the concept closer to how Porras and Collins viewed Core Values as well.\nWhere Lencioni is in disagreement with Collins and Porras is that Core Values can differentiate you competitively in the market place and actually attract or repel customers.\nDo you build your Core Values to Differentiate your business and use them as a competitive advantage as Patrick Lencioni believes or do you believe as Collins and Porras do that it’s not critical to make this distinction with your Core Values?\nMy client today reviewed their Core Values remaining focused on the principles that Collins and Porras offered in the 1996 HBR article. They chose not to immerse their Core Values in Lencioni’s direction as he discussed in The Advantage, although the changes they made in our meeting especially those dedicated to customer service could be seen as attracting or repelling a specific type of customer.\nMost importantly they chose to remain authentic to who they are now. Their Core Values add a deep sense of clarity to their organization. An area of agreement for both Lencioni and Collins and Porras is this: How do we get people to share our core ideology? You don’t. You can’t. Instead, find people who are predisposed to share your core values and purpose; attract and retain those people; and let those who do not share your core values go elsewhere. Indeed, the very process of articulating core ideology may cause some people to leave when they realize that they are not personally compatible with the organization’s core.\nAsk yourself if your Core Values achieve this? You do have a set of Core Values don’t you?\nWhat’s the importance of Core Values for your company? We’ll look at two critical values they provide in my next blog.",

    "content": "Efficiency and effectiveness: building a high-performing team\nOctober 2022 | FEATURE | LABOUR & EMPLOYMENT\nFinancier Worldwide Magazine\nOctober 2022 Issue\nMany factors can help drive the success of a business, perhaps none more so than its employees. With great dedication, variegated knowledge and specialised competencies, talented workers can truly make a difference in any organisation. In an increasingly complex economic landscape, organisations are more reliant on high-performing teams to cope with growing challenges, differentiate themselves from the competition and take the business forward.\nThese highly skilled individuals, working in cross-functional areas, with shared vision and values, focus on achieving common business goals. According to a 2019 report from Deloitte, “shifting toward a team-based organisational model improves performance, often significantly”. Fifty-three percent of respondents to Deloitte’s survey said they experienced a significant improvement in performance since transitioning to a team or network-based organisation.\n“Members of top-performing teams share high expectations of one another and a purpose that is explicit, consequential, strengthening and aligning,” explains Cheryl Fields Tyler, founder and chief executive of Blue Beyond Consulting. “The team and individual members have goals that are clear and compelling, and that require learning and teamwork to achieve. Team members also cultivate and value diverse perspectives, effective collaboration and ‘group genius’, and they exhibit a growth mindset and commitment to a high standard of excellence.”\nOne way businesses can build high-performance teams is by reimagining operating models in the digitally disrupted, post-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic world. For instance, Deloitte has advocated for companies to “do more with less, reduce operating costs, and create additional capacity to fuel the mission and business in the midst of shrinking budgets, all while creating an engaged and agile workforce”. By leaning into agility and resiliency while driving efficiencies, companies should prioritise areas such as cross-functional collaboration, resource sharing and talent agility, improved customer and employee experiences, augmented data availability, enhanced operational responsiveness, and greater digital integration and modernisation. In this way, companies can emerge from the pandemic era leaner and more focused.\nFrom an operational perspective, many companies were forced to make short-term cuts to achieve immediate cost reductions and keep the lights on through the pandemic – a typical response to crisis. But according to Deloitte, making such cuts often means companies overlook key opportunities to redesign for optimised value delivery, revenue growth and market share in a sustainable manner. With efficiency and effectiveness front of mind, companies should address obsolete structures, capabilities, roles, processes, technology and organisational culture. The pandemic allowed some companies to address these issues, but, in practice, sustaining high-performance teams should see businesses adapt their operating models, funding and governance processes continually.\nEssential elements\nAccording to McKinsey, the best-performing teams in a workplace consist of at least six members, but no more than 10. Fewer individuals means less diversity and fewer ideas. On the other hand, larger teams may become less effective as ‘sub-teams’ start to form, leading to divisive and distracting behaviour.\nFor Ms Fields Tyler, one of the key characteristics of a high-performing team is that it embodies a culture of not only high expectations but also deep trust. “Deep trust means that team members know and appreciate each other as individuals, and they feel psychologically safe to show up, speak up, and contribute without fear of punishment, humiliation or manipulation,” she explains. “It means everyone gives and receives authentic appreciation and constructive, candid feedback that in turn fosters productive and respectful dialogue and debate.”\nSelecting the right people is, of course, vital, and diverse, socially sensitive groups are often more successful. According to a study by academics from MIT, Carnegie Mellon and Union College, the proportion of females in a group can be positively correlated with the collective intelligence of a group, likely because women scored higher than men on social sensitivity. Having the right skills and mindset is also crucial, and this includes being open to change.\nIn the view of Polly Rodway, a partner at Brahams Dutt Badrick French LLP, the essential element of a high-performing team is communication. “An open channel for communication, recognition of its importance within the team, and structures in place to ensure effective communication are essential,” she notes. “This enables a team to appreciate and recognise different strengths and play to them. It also helps to facilitate respect and support for each other, which brings out the best of each team member and in turn translates to high quality work product and a happy work environment.”\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, personal wellness and wellbeing have perhaps never been more present in employees’ minds. Companies that ignore this fact may find it almost impossible to cultivate high-performing teams. “Firms have a duty to provide a safe place of work for their employees,” says Ms Rodway. “They also have a duty to make reasonable adjustments for disabled employees. These are good reasons why firms should take wellness considerations into account. Legalities aside, firms perform better when employees are healthy, motivated and focused.”\nThe pandemic certainly changed the playing field, redefining our concept of the workplace and altering our perceptions of work-life balance. As Ms Rodway attests, the pandemic forced us all to reflect on the interaction between our professional and personal lives. “For many, it forced down the physical barriers between the two, with employees working from home, often with partners, children and pets in the same location,” she says. “As a result, in order to protect wellbeing, employees and employers have had to establish virtual barriers in their place. This might be in the form of out of hours email policies, encouraging time off or establishing wellness support at work.”\nAccording to Ms Fields Tyler, the way the world has evolved over the last few years has put tremendous pressure on people, not least due to the anxiety caused by the ongoing pandemic. “The levels of stress and burnout in our society really take a toll, and a business cannot thrive if its people are not thriving,” she says. “The lessons of the pandemic are to trust our people, practice empathy, prioritise health and wellbeing and reinvest ourselves – so we can do our best work with thought, care, good humour and joy.”\nTo ensure that employees continue to perform, companies need to monitor the health of their employees and react to signs of potential problems. “Leaders and managers must be equipped to demonstrate empathy by noticing employees who may be struggling with mental health or physical health issues,” argues Ms Fields Tyler. “They must invest in building relationships, listen supportively to team members and guide them to helpful resources. They must also model inclusive flexibility as well as model or champion wellness efforts. Helping to prioritise what must get done – and what can slide if necessary – can go a long way in alleviating stress and burnout.\n“First we had to learn how to be efficient and effective working from home – all while setting boundaries to avoid burnout and work toward an unprecedented work-life integration. Now, many employees are having to relearn many of the same things while back in the office or working in blended environments,” she adds.\nLeading from the front\nOne of the most important elements of building high-performing teams is leadership. Leaders must be able to form and guide teams that can achieve or exceed organisational objectives in a changing business environment. They must understand how to create the conditions that allow their teams to perform at a high level, using the tools necessary to create better alignment, engagement and accountability within the organisation. And they need the ability to apply their knowledge effectively to whatever commercial situation they face, driving continual improvement.\n“Team leaders and management in general are essential ingredients in delivering high-performing teams,” believes Ms Fields Tyler. “They create the weather in the organisation, the implicit and explicit expectations that signal to people what is important.\n“It starts at the top with the chief executive and executive team, but they alone are not enough,” she continues. “Team leaders – and their managers – need to be enfranchised to the purpose, values and vision of the company. They need to know why the work they are doing is important for the business, for the customers and for the employees. They need to be equipped, enabled and held accountable to be those kinds of leaders.”\nTeam leaders should take an inventory of the skills, talents, abilities, education and experiences of their team members, evaluate them, and form a plan to maximise these qualities. That will involve developing team goals, providing feedback on performance, devising appropriate rewards and remuneration, and conducting training, among others.\nThe war for talent has empowered employees to expect more from the companies they work for – and collaboration is high on the list. “Team efficiency and effectiveness are essential because high-performing teams deliver results and it is what employees want,” says Ms Fields Tyler. “Indeed, many say ‘working with a great team’ is their primary reason for staying with an employer. When deep trust and high expectations work together in an elevating, virtuous cycle, businesses see higher employee engagement and stronger business outcomes.\n“Our research suggests that employees overwhelmingly regard collaboration as important but only about a quarter of knowledge workers strongly believe their company is good at it. Leaders can inspire their teams toward better performance by a deliberate and thoughtful process based on trust and accountability that sets clear expectations, fosters team cohesion, and encourages excellence through a clear and compelling purpose,” she adds.\nBuilding a high-performing team is not easy; there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach. Leaders need to be able to identify the unique needs of team members and see that those needs are met. “Firms should enable employees to have a positive relationship with work,” suggests Ms Rodway. “This, in turn, is likely to result in better work product, as when employees feel valued and supported, they are more willing to strive further for the workplace and its clients.\n“In most businesses, a firm’s employees are its best asset,” she continues. “Talent retention is essential. When you lose talent, you not only lose that individual, but you lose some stability in the workforce. Firms face significant challenges in staff retention because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the way our working lives have changed. Not only are firms competing over remuneration, but also over working arrangements and flexibility. This is something we have not had to confront in such a way until now. It dramatically raises the stakes for retention as well as recruitment.”\nHigh-performing teams can unlock competitive advantage for firms. By taking steps such as setting achievable objectives, prioritising communication and being transparent with employees, companies can empower their team members to contribute to a shared objective by delivering optimal results.\n© Financier Worldwide\nBY\nRichard Summerfield",

    "content": "After-action review\nAn after action review (AAR) is a technique for improving process and execution by analyzing the intended outcome and actual outcome of an action and identifying practices to sustain, and practices to improve or initiate, and then practicing those changes at the next iteration of the action[1][2] AARs in the formal sense were originally developed by the U.S. Army.[3] Formal AARs are used by all US military services and by many other non-US organizations.[4] Their use has extended to business as a knowledge management tool.[5]\nAn AAR occurs within a cycle of establishing the leader's intent, planning, preparation, action and review.[6] An AAR is distinct from a de-brief in that it begins with a clear comparison of intended versus actual results achieved.[1] An AAR is forward-looking, with the goal of informing future planning, preparation, and execution of similar actions. Assigning blame or issuing reprimands is antithetical to the purpose of an AAR. An AAR is distinct from a post-mortem in its tight focus on participants' own actions; learning from the review is taken forward by the participants.[7] Recommendations for others are not produced. AARs in larger operations can be cascaded in order to keep each level of the organization focused on its own performance within a particular event or project.[7]\nFormal AAR meetings are normally run by a facilitator or trained 'AAR Conductor', and can be chronological reviews or tightly focused on a few key issues selected by the team leader.[7] Short cycle informal AARs are typically run by a team leader or assistant and are very quick.[7]\nAfter action reviews in the British National Health Service\n[edit]In the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS), AAR is increasingly used as a learning tool to promote patient safety[8] and improve care, as outlined by Walker et al. 2012.[9] In the UK and Europe other healthcare organisations, including pharmaceutical and medical technology businesses such as BD, are beginning to roll out their own AAR programmes.\nIn 2008, a group of senior leaders within University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust acted on the realization that bullying and blaming behaviours were impacting on safe and effective care. They commissioned the UCLH Education service to tackle the problem, and AAR was chosen as the tool to use.\nIn 2011, Professor Aidan Hallighan, UCLH's Director of Education, wrote \"Healthcare is dominated by the extreme, the unknown and the very improbable with high impact consequences, conditions that demand leadership, and yet we spend our time focusing on what we know and what we can control. Educating staff on the use of After Action Review enables team working and cues behaviours through allowing an emotional mastery of the moment and learning after doing.\"[10]\n\"AARs are applicable to almost any event, clinical or otherwise, and whilst the emphasis is on learning after less than perfect events, AARs after successful experiences can also provide rich benefits. Prerequisite to the success of a formal AAR are a few key ingredients, including a trained ‘conductor’, a suitable safe private environment, allocated time and the assumption of equality of everybody present. Every AAR follows the same structure with the conductor getting agreement for the ground rules at the outset and ensuring everyone is clear about the specific purpose of the AAR and the four apparently simple questions to be used.\"[9]\nAAR is actively used in a number of NHS organisations including Cambridge University Hospitals, Bedfordshire Hospitals and NEL Healthcare Consulting and has been recommended as an approach to be used in the new NHS Patient Safety Incident Response Framework, which \"moves away from reactive and hard-to-define thresholds for 'Serious Incident' investigation and towards a proactive approach to learning from incidents.\"[11]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ a b Cronin, Gerard; Andrews, Steven (2 June 2009). \"After action reviews: a new model for learning: Gerard Cronin and Steven Andrews explain why after action reviews are an ideal model for healthcare professionals to analyse and learn from events\".

    "content": "Why You Should Separate Salary And Performance\nWe all believe a great school report deserves a tenner, right? Well, I disagree. Here's why I believe that. And how that translates to separating salary from performance. Good performance brings its own rewards, and especially in the workplace.\nAs school was out for summer break my kids brought home their reports. A few marks they didn’t agree with, but I was super proud of them regardless. So how could I express my pride through a reward?\nI remember that I always got a couple of guilders from my parents. My grandparents even pressed ten guilders into my hand when I visited with report in hand. Upon leaving, I would go directly to the store to buy ice cream with my reward.\nSo, it seems to make sense to reward my daughters with a bonus for their reports, right? But it's not that simple.\nWhat I took for granted as a child, I have a harder time accepting as a parent. I am proud of my children. But it always seems it needs to be linked to financial rewards. Some friends figure that the higher the marks, the higher the rewards.\nPattern of reward and punishment\nA child nowadays grows up in a world where rewards (and punishments) are embedded. At school, you get a sticker from the teacher for the right answer. And, at home you get an ice cream for stacking the dishwasher. This sets the tone for life.\nAnd the pattern continues in working life. No wonder we come to think that if you perform well, you’ll receive a financial reward. The other side of this coin is if you perform less or stop performing if there’s no prospect of a reward.\nMeanwhile, people just basically want to do well and grow. They and we are intrinsically motivated to deliver good performance. Nevertheless, companies continue to link financial incentives to performance.\nArguments\nMaybe you agree with me and maybe you don't. But if you're looking for reasons to decouple performance and financial rewards, here are a few:\n1. Intrinsic motivation leads to better performance\nResearch shows intrinsic motivation leads to better performance. People become more creative and work better together.\nMoreover, extrinsic motivation (financial) can lead to poorer performance (read the book Drive by Daniel Pink).\nAn example? People can start working with tunnel vision and adopt what the Dutch refer to as ‘elbow work’ (pushing others aside with one's elbows as an ungracious way to treat competition) instead of working together.\nMoreover, performance targets given at the start of the year can become unfeasible during the year. Or you perform incredibly well in areas for which you were not rewarded because they were not designated targets.\n2. The Dunning-Kruger Effect\nPerformance rewards are (usually) given by managers in performance reviews. Even if you get feedback from your peers, the Dunning-Kruger Effect still plays a major role. It says it’s human nature to overestimate our own skills and achievements.\nMost of us think we perform at above average level. Mathematically speaking, that’s not possible.\nEqually, the manager may feel he has above-average skill for assessing employee performance. It’s dangerous to link financial rewards to the performance of an employee in that context.\n3. The Peter Principle\nIn organizations with traditional hierarchies, employees rise to their level of incompetence. Then they cease to add to the success of the organization.\nYou probably know an example of the best craftsman or professional being promoted to team leader and manager, while the best accountant, painter or customer service employee is in not guaranteed to be the best manager.\nSo, there are quite a few incompetent managers around who, driven by the Dunning-Kruger Effect (see above), still carry responsibility for assessing performance and the salary consequences.\n4. Iceberg of Ignorance\nThis theory from 1989 assumes that the higher you climb in the hierarchy, the less you know of the problems, challenges and achievements on the work floor.\nThus there is a lack of information to be able to properly assess staff performances. And yet managers, elevated within the hierarchy, are expected to judge their employees on performance.\n5. Conflicting interests in the traditional managerial position\nDutch professor Kilian Wawoe describes (in Performance Management in an Agile Work Environment) that a lot is expected of a manager. For example, being a good coach, having an inspirational talk with someone not feeling at their best, or motivating them to pursue a dot on the horizon, etc.: the 'soft' side, so to speak.\nBut you are also expected to set top-down priorities for the team, distribute work optimally so that targets are achieved and, at the end of the year, present a motivational and substantive performance review.\nYou do all this while maintaining a safe, open atmosphere and providing people with constructive feedback. Then you can translate all this into the right increases for the employees who deserve them - while working with a limited budget...\nNo wonder few are beaming with enthusiasm after an annual performance review…\nOpen to discussion\nSome of the studies above are open to discussion. But if only half true, I’d still advise taking a critical look at classic performance management, and the cycle that consists of setting goals, turning judgements into scores, and the consequences for salaries.\nIn addition to lots of time, money, frustration and paperwork, it can even be dangerous. Moreover, it doesn’t fit well in today's agile working environment.\nSo what is the alternative?\nPerformance disconnect\nAt Viisi, we have completely decoupled performance and salary development. Everyone in the same field is given the same salary increase. It is then up to the teams to come up with roles, divide the work, supply each other with feedback, and achieve their goals together, without being sidetracked by salary issues.\nWe also divide the manager function (with the help of Holacracy) into different roles, and assign them to people who have talent for them, and therefore not to one single person who, because he or she is the manager, must be capable of doing everything.\nAnd what about rewards? Just pay people a decent salary. And hand out ice creams for fun, because they’re delicious.\nBelieve me, that ice cream will taste infinitely better. Enjoy! :)\nRun a better business\nWant to learn concrete steps on how to run a better business?\nWe recommend you to take a look at our Corporate Rebels Academy which offers a wide range of on-demand courses that will help guide your team and organization to effectively implement radically new ways of working.

    "content": "Refresher: What are KPIs?\nKPI stands for Key Performance Indicator. Key Performance Indicators are connected to your goals and objectives—they are quantifiable, outcome-based statements that outline and measure your organization’s most important outputs.\nThis article explains how to develop and identify KPIs for your strategic plan.\nKPIs tell you what you want to achieve and by when you want to achieve it. A good plan will include 5-7 KPIs to manage and track the plan’s progress.\nWhy Do I Need to Identify KPIs?\nKPIs are the heartbeat of your performance management process. They are the metrics that tell you whether you are making progress in accordance with your strategy. This means you’re going to work with KPIs a lot, which is why you need to make sure they work well for you. This article will give you the basic guidelines you need to not only know how to identify KPIs, but also how to set up tracking for your KPIs so that they work for you successfully.\nGet the Free Guide for Creating KPIs (with 100 Examples!)\nHow to Identify KPIs & Set Up Tracking\nStep 1: Structure your KPIs based on measures that contribute directly to your organization’s annual objectives.\nIn thinking about how to identify KPIs that will work for your organization, there are five primary components to consider:\n- Your first step is to look at your organization’s objective and identify a measure, or quantifiable marker, of where you are now.\nYou’ll want to make these measures as expressive as possible. For example, “number of new customers” is fine, but identifying the number of new customers within a given timeframe or the number of new customers for a particular product or strategy is better. - Next, you’ll need to identify a target, a numerical representation of where you want to be with this objective. This should be directly comparable to the measure indicating where you are now. It should also include a time period by which you want to achieve the goal.\n- It’s common to have many different places where you are tracking data, so each KPI needs a clearly identified data source. You need to be able to easily, quickly, and objectively identify where and how this information is being tracked.\n- Then, you’ll need to determinethe frequency, or how often you will be reporting on this KPI. Ideally, this will be at least monthly. However, different KPIs will have different timelines that are appropriate.\n- Finally, like any good goal, each KPI needs to havean owner. You need to know who is in charge of tracking and strategizing with this KPI.\nAs you determine the indicators you want to track, keep in mind that you can measure raw numbers (number of new customers, for example), progress (like the percent completion of a goal), or change (for instance, percent increase in sales). Tracking progress or change do a better job of telling a story with numbers than just, rigid counting, or tracking raw numbers.\nYou’ll also want to consider that there are leading and lagging measures.\n- Lagging indicators, such as a percent increase in sales, measure outcome—what has already happened. Therefore, they “lag” behind your performance.\n- Leading indicators help show whether you are on track to hit your target. They focus on the future and give you clues about what you can expect. For example, a KPI that includes your cost of operations can be a leading indicator that predicts decreases in profits if certain costs increase. Similarly, a KPI that measures the success of your website will likely indicate upcoming increases in sales.\nPro Tip:\nWe recommend a combination of leading and lagging indicators. Try to split them evenly if you can.\nStep 2: Evaluate the quality of your new KPIs.\nAgain, it is important that the KPIs you choose to track and measure your progress are ones that work well for your organization. Here are some questions to consider that will help you determine how to identify KPIs that will best reflect your progress against your strategy:\n- Is this KPI easily quantifiable? If you can’t measure this variable numerically, it will be very difficult to objectively identify progress toward a goal.\n- Is this KPI within our control? Can we drive change in this KPI? Your KPIs will only be as useful as you can use them. If they measure external factors rather than ones that you can control, then they won’t tell you what you need to do to achieve your targets.\n- Does this KPI connect directly to our objective as well as overall strategy? Your KPIs are meant to track not just your outputs, but how you are measuring up to the goals you have set for your organization. You want to choose KPIs that are directly relevant to those objectives.\n- Is this KPI simply defined and understandable? Remember that you are going to be working with this KPI at least monthly (in some cases, weekly or even daily). It needs to be something you can conceptualize and communicate, not only for yourself, but for everyone in the organization who will be working with this KPI.\n- Can this KPI be measured with accuracy and timeliness? Sometimes the trickiest part of identifying a KPI is setting up processes to collect accurate and consistent data for it. KPIs can only be useful if they are accurate, and as we’ve discussed, they need to be reported regularly (at least monthly). This needs to be part of the consideration as you are identifying your KPIs and how you will measure them.\n- Do our KPIs give a broad range of perspectives on our organization’s success? For example, do you have measures to reflect your progress not only among customers, but also in your organization’s finances, internal processes, and learning and growth?\n- Will this KPI remain relevant? For consistency and stability in tracking your progress, try to choose KPIs that will serve your organization for the foreseeable future.\nStep 3: Assign ownership for each KPI to specific individuals in the organization.\nYou need to know where the ball stops. You also want individuals within your organization to feel invested in its success, and ownership of a KPI encourages this kind of positively motivated accountability.\nWho in your organization is best equipped to track, interpret, and report on this KPI? Assign responsibility and make sure that expectations are clear, and individuals have the resources to accurately and consistently track these KPIs, as well as a way to communicate them to leadership, other staff members, or other stakeholders as necessary.\nStep 4: Monitor and report on the KPIs regularly and transparently.\nIdentifying and setting up tracking for each of your KPIs is important initial work to developing your strategy. Moving forward, you will need to determine not only—as mentioned above—how often you will track each one, but also how you will report on them. You might take time in your weekly staff meetings to report on KPIs, for example.\nYou will need to determine the best way to monitor and report on these KPIs so your entire organization knows where you are and where you want to be in terms of your organizational strategy. You want everyone to see how their work contributes to organizational objectives.",

    "content": "The Bad Apple: Group Poison\nA recent episode of This American Life interviewed Will Felps, a professor who conducted a sociological experiment demonstrating the surprisingly powerful effect of bad apples.\nGroups of four college students were organized into teams and given a task to complete some basic management decisions in 45 minutes. To motivate the teams, they’re told that whichever team performs best will be awarded $100 per person. What they don’t know, however, is that in some of the groups, the fourth member of their team isn’t a student. He’s an actor hired to play a bad apple, one of these personality types:\n- The Depressive Pessimist will complain that the task that they’re doing isn’t enjoyable, and make statements doubting the group’s ability to succeed.\n- The Jerk will say that other people’s ideas are not adequate, but will offer no alternatives himself. He’ll say “you guys need to listen to the expert: me.”\n- The Slacker will say “whatever,” and “I really don’t care.”\nThe conventional wisdom in the research on this sort of thing is that none of this should have had much effect on the group at all. Groups are powerful. Group dynamics are powerful. And so groups dominate individuals, not the other way around. There’s tons of research, going back decades, demonstrating that people conform to group values and norms.\nBut Will found the opposite.\nInvariably, groups that had the bad apple would perform worse. And this despite the fact that were people in some groups that were very talented, very smart, very likeable. Felps found that the bad apple’s behavior had a profound effect – groups with bad apples performed 30 to 40 percent worse than other groups. On teams with the bad apple, people would argue and fight, they didn’t share relevant information, they communicated less.\nEven worse, other team members began to take on the bad apple’s characteristics. When the bad apple was a jerk, other team members would begin acting like a jerk. When he was a slacker, they began to slack, too. And they wouldn’t act this way just in response to the bad apple. They’d act this way to each other, in sort of a spillover effect.\nWhat they found, in short, is that the worst team member is the best predictor of how any team performs. It doesn’t seem to matter how great the best member is, or what the average member of the group is like. It all comes down to what your worst team member is like. The teams with the worst person performed the poorest.\nThe actual text of the study (pdf) is available if you’re interested. However, I highly recommend listening to the first 11 minutes of the This American Life show. It’s a fascinating, highly compelling recap of the study results. I’ve summarized, but I can’t really do it justice without transcribing it all here.\nIra Glass, the host of This American Life, found Felps’ results so striking that he began to question his own teamwork:\nI’ve really been struck at how common bad apples are. Truthfully, I’ve been kind of haunted by my conversation with Will Felps. Hearing about his research, you realize just how easy it is to poison any group [. . .] each of us have had moments this week where we wonder if we, unwittingly, have become the bad apples in our group.\nAs always, self-awareness is the first step. If you can’t tell who the bad apple is in your group, it might be you. Consider your own behavior on your own team – are you slipping into any of these negative bad apple behavior patterns, even in a small way?\nBut there was a solitary glimmer of hope in the study, one particular group that bucked the trend:\nThere was one group that performed really well, despite the bad apple. There was just one guy, who was a particularly good leader. And what he would do is ask questions, he would engage all the team members, and diffuse conflicts. I found out later that he’s actually the son of a diplomat. His father is a diplomat from some South American country. He had this amazing diplomatic ability to diffuse the conflict that normally would emerge when our actor, Nick, would display all this jerk behavior.\nThis apparently led Will to his next research project: can a group leader change the dynamics and performance of a group by going around and asking questions, soliciting everyone’s opinions, and making sure everyone is heard?\nWhile it’s depressing to learn that a group can be so powerfully affected by the worst tendencies of a single member, it’s heartening to know that a skilled leader, if you’re lucky enough to have one, can intervene and potentially control the situation.\nStill, the obvious solution is to address the problem at its source: get rid of the bad apple.\nEven if it’s you.",

    "content": "Experts say leadership failure has many signs but they have narrowed the cause to a few that stand out. Few site competence, or knowledge, or lack of experience. When Claudio Fernando-Araoz, head of research for the executive recruitment firm Egon Zehnder International, looked at CEOs who had succeeded and those who had failed, he found the same pattern in America, Germany and Japan: those who failed were hired on the basis of their drive, IQ, and business expertise – but fired for lack of emotional intelligence. They simply could not win over, or sometimes even just get along with, their board of directors, or their direct reports, or others on whom their own success depended.”\nIn 1999, CEO consultant and advisor RamCharan and Fortune’s Geoffrey Colvin studied over 40 failed CEOs from Fortune 500 companies to see what went wrong. They identified the fatal flaw of these CEOs as execution. But the reason for the execution failure was even simpler and more basic. The problem was with people, specifically their inability in not having the right person in the right job. In some case they held on to some people too long, in other cases they were unable to coach them in the desired direction.\nIn their Fortune article, Charan and Colvin explained that unsuccessful CEOs lacked emotional strength when it came down to personnel decisions. In short, the fatal flaw of “failure to execute” was due to bad personnel decisions.\nRonald Riggio, the Henry Kravis professor of leadership and organizationqal Psychology at Claremont McKenna College, and author of “The Clueless Leader,” thinks leaders in dysfunctional organizations are simply out of touch with how bad things are. He compares them to Michael Scott from the TV show “The Office,” who simply doesn’t realize how bad thing are or simply doesn’t care. Riggio recalls discussing with the president of one organization the possibility of an employee survey to try to get a handle on how disgruntled employees had become. “Why would we want to do that?” was the clueless response.\nIn their book, “Why CEOs Fail: The 11 Behaviors That Can Derail Your Climb To The Top And How To Manage Them, “ David Dotlich, a former Honeywell executive and Peter Cairo offer 11 cogent reasons why CEOs fail, most of which have to do with hubris, ego and a lack of emotional intelligence. They describe the most common characteristics of derailed top executives and how you can avoid them:\n§ Arrogance— you think that you’re right, and everyone else is wrong.\n§ Melodrama— you need to be the center of attention.\n§ Volatility— you’re subject to mood swings.\n§ Excessive Caution— you’re afraid to make decisions.\n§ Habitual Distrust— you focus on the negatives.\n§ Aloofness — you’re disengaged and disconnected.\n§ Mischievousness— you believe that rules are made to be broken.\n§ Eccentricity— you try to be different just for the sake of it.\n§ Passive Resistance— what you say is not what you really believe.\n§ Perfectionism— you get the little things right and the big things wrong.\n§ Eagerness to Please— you try to win the popularity contest.\nThere are no universal ways to prevent failures, except perhaps to be alert for the warning signs. In today’s culture some executives are larger than life and expected to be perfect. Few like to admit they have flaws—even when those around them can plainly see their flaws.\nCandid feedback is seen as helpful and a corrective, but who can provide this? Not employees or board members. A confidante, mentor or a trusted coach can help. But in today’s high-pressure environment, leaders need someone they can trust to tell the truth about their behavior. This is where an outside professional executive coach can help leaders reduce or eliminate blind spots and be open to constructive feedback, not only reducing the likelihood of failure, and premature burnout, but also provide an atmosphere in which the executive can express fears, failures and dreams.\nRead: https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/6763-7.html\nRead: https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenmakovsky/2012/03/22/the-reason-ceos-fail-an-update/",

    "content": "“Time is an inelastic resource. No matter how high the demand, we cannot rent, hire, or buy more of it.”\n-Peter Drucker\nA Quick Note: This is a lengthy blog, but if you read it you’ll already be spending your time in an area where you should be spending your time (as you’ll see toward the end). So sit back, give yourself the gift of time, and enjoy the read.\nA primary focus of my job is to help middle-market CEOs and their Executive Officers increase their efficiency while also (and more importantly) increasing their effectiveness. Most CEOs I work with tend to agree that there’s never enough time in a day to do everything that needs to be done. As their companies grow and hit various ceilings of complexity, CEOs find that they, too, hit their ceilings of complexity. This realization is all-consuming and inundating, with the result being a string of behaviors that play out to result in focusing on what’s in front of them—on what they perceive deserves their time and attention at that moment in time (and many times, this intense focus also leads to long—very long—work hours). Interestingly, Harvard Business Review researchers found that the most effective leaders aren't the ones who constantly work a ton of hours each week, but rather the ones who are the most attentive and focused while at work. Most CEOs intend to be attentive and focused, yet the hunger to simply work long hours so they can do more can be a massive beast that slowly devours the most valuable resource CEOs have: Time.\nAs an Executive Coach, it’s my job to expedite the impact of executive officers by helping them discover how their time should be spent to maximize their time and increase their influence with the leadership team. With most of my coachees, it’s the Golden Question, “How should I be spending my time as a CEO?” The Golden Answer requires a shift in how CEOs think. Without a shift in thinking there will be little to no meaningful, higher-level shift in the executive’s daily routine.\nA Prerequisite for Knowing Where to Spend Your Time\nTradition breeds the way we think. Therefore, a prerequisite to knowing where to spend your time requires first challenging your assumptions about the role itself. For instance, it’s assumed by many that working long hours is simply a CEO's lot in life. It’s just what CEOs do (so you end up pushing yourself to work longer hours). Yet, there is a huge body of research that tells us that working longer hours does not equal higher levels of productivity. Longer hours also don’t equate to effectiveness, either. (Argue as you will, but the research is quite conclusive.) To be an effective CEO requires you to walk away from this and other false perceptions of what constitutes success for a CEO. The prerequisite, then, is for you to challenge your assumptions about what it means to be a CEO.\nParkinson's Law, first published in The Economist in 1955, states that \"work is elastic in its time.\" This means that if you set aside one hour to write a report, it'll take you the full hour. If you set aside 15 minutes, it will take 15 minutes.\nLook to stop working harder. Instead, think about how you can work differently. You’ll never be able to frame your time to the very minute because “life happens.” But you can gain a lot more control if you know what you should try to be attentive to and focused on as a rule. Just realize, too, that there’s a yin-yang to this whole endeavor of spending your time wisely in that it takes a ton of flexibility and discipline. As noted by Elena Botelhos, founder of the leadership research firm CEO Genome Project, “Often, when CEOs conduct calendar reviews and look at how their time is spent, they’re surprised to find that top priorities are regularly trumped by urgent fires.”\nSo be flexible, but also employ the discipline needed to be focused and attentive to what matters for you to be an effective leader of a growing company.\nHow Should CEOs Spend Their Time?\nHere are a few thoughts for your consideration as you strive to answer the question of how you should be spending your time. As I noted upfront, this is a longer read than a typical blog post, so simply sit back and allow the following points to stir your thinking.\nRemember:\n(a) How a CEO chooses to spend his/her time can depend on a multitude of variables, such as where the company is in its growth trajectory, the industry, how big an internal or external challenge is at the current moment in time, etc. The bottom line, though, is that there are core elements every CEO should work toward so that s/he can steer a growth company in the right direction. In other words, CEOs should focus on running their companies so that their companies don’t run them. They should use their executive assistants effectively to manage their time.\n(b) Secondly, remember that the percentages below are approximate. At certain times, you’ll spend more time on the strategic components (such as developing your 3 Year Strategic Plan and managing cash flow) or you’ll spend more time analyzing a gap and being a solution resource for a situation of primary importance, etc. The point is to strive for the approximations below to maximize your time for efficiency and effectiveness with your executive coaching engagement.\nCEOs Should Spend 40% of Their Work Time on the Future\nAs examples:\nLead to a Clarified Vision. Vision casting isn’t every CEO's favorite thing to do. With that said, though, challenge your assumptions about what spending time on the future means. It doesn’t mean you must be ‘good’ at visioning or dreaming about the blue business sky of tomorrow. It means that you must spend your time leading people toward the future. You can’t do this effectively without a good BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) and/or without a definition of where you want the company to be three to five years from now. Where you want to be (and perhaps what you want the company to be known for) defines where you spend your time today.\nSpend time creating opportunities by being ‘outward’ vs. ‘inward.’ An interesting analogy presents the CEO as the captain of the Titanic. The captain of the Titanic had talented and capable engineers in the engine room, great shows and entertainment onboard the ship, incredible chefs who delivered the best cuisine, and a wonderfully focused crew to take care of the ship’s guests. At the time, too, he had what was lauded as the most awesome ship in the world. With all these advantages, though, the captain still didn’t see the iceberg. So the ensuing question from this analogy is, “Should a CEO be looking inward or outward?”\nSpend your time keeping your company’s financial reservoir fueled by looking outward. By looking outward, you help focus your company’s future by being the creator of opportunities. In tandem, set the expectation for your executive team to teach their people how they’ll need to think about the future. For instance, salespeople may need to update their approach from a typical sales approach to more of a consultative one because your defined future may require them to become less transactional to engage more fully with core customer value. You can’t ignore internal operations but spend the bulk of your time on the external components that will fuel your company’s growth tank (i.e., building opportunities for the injection of new revenue) vs. spending time with an internal focus.\nThink of being ‘outward’ this way: Productivity serves to keep things moving internally (and it’s important), but productivity alone probably won’t make you #1 or #2 within a given market. Hire strong leaders to lead internal operations and maximize efficiencies and product/service delivery. You should only spend time internally if there are major issues (which might tell you that some adjustments around people and/or expectations need to be made). A key point here is that rarely are great companies built by the singular activity of sitting at a desk.\nCreate your future org chart. Draft it out. Don’t use names; just stick to titles that are recognizable to you such as CFO, EVP of Talent, CFO, Controller, etc. (You can change titles to something better later if desired; for now, though, just stick to titles that are a rote description of the positions.) As time passes, review your future chart. Revise it. Refine it. Work with it. Spend face-to-face time with the future leadership of your organization and learn their strengths and weaknesses.\nWhich areas are already filled with the right person? Which areas might someone grow into, and what might you do to encourage that person to grow so s/he is prepared for the new role when the company’s ready for it? Where is there a spot that’s currently filled, but the person just isn’t in the right seat? What might you do about that in the near term so that you’re better prepared to meet the future? Which spots don’t exist today but will need to be filled later? Prioritize those. Purposefully map the human side of your company’s future.\nNew CEOS will want to read our specialized article with 11 tips to get started as a new CEO.\nCEOs Should Spend 30% of Their Time on Strategy\nAs strategy execution examples:\nSpend time being strategic. With your executive team, jointly create three to five year goals (i.e., In three to five years, what do we want to be known for? What do we want to have accomplished by a point in time?). With this defined, be the rock on your team that gives time to set expectations around what the team will do this coming year as the first step toward your three to five year vision. What’s your Annual Plan? From this point, what’s your Quarterly Plan for the next quarter? Button everything up by identifying who’s accountable for what and by clearly defining what success looks like. Allow your leaders to take ownership.\nOnce your strategic roadmap is created, you can define where you should spend your time, internally and externally: Based on your strategic roadmap, should you spend time with key stakeholders? With essential supply chain partners? With your potential customer base? With current core customers who might grow their accounts with you? What is your CEO KPI dashboard telling you?\nCreate Accountability and a Culture of Transparency. Raise the bar on transparency while also raising the bar on personal accountability. This is probably the greatest advantage of a tool such as the Rhythm Dashboard. Each quarter is a 13-Week Race to accomplish a set of Quarterly Priorities that will take your company to where you want to be by year-end. Each week, your team members should each status the Quarterly Priorities they own so you can be more proactive than reactive by solving real-time problems, issues, and challenges during your Weekly Team Meetings. This type of transparency also builds a higher level of personal accountability throughout your organization. Work very hard to build accountable leaders and teams.\nUse your Weekly Meetings to streamline problem-solving. CEOs should gravitate toward concepts of ‘leadership’ vs. ‘management.’ Stop training the leaders that surround you to come to you to solve every single problem. You should steer these leaders to solve their own problems. Asking for your thoughts or expertise is fine, but this shouldn’t take hours and hours of your time, nor should you be pulled into every single meeting. As long as you let yourself be the #1 problem solver, people will come to you again and again to solve problems they should be effectively solving on their own.\nSimilarly, as long you think your presence is needed in almost every meeting, then progress will be stifled (because if you're unable to be present, no one will make any decisions because they’ll be waiting on you). Work to be a resource, but don’t work to be the one and only solution provider. If you have effective Weekly Meetings, then problems worthy of time should be discussed there. To borrow a concept from Apple, your executive team is your Genius Bar, so use the collective intelligence of your team as a resource to foster joint problem-solving on the issues that matter. Use your weekly team meetings as the platform for these discussions vs. one-on-one sit-down meetings that waste your time.\nCEOs Should Spend 15% of Their Time Analyzing Key Success Factors\nAs examples:\nPay attention to your company culture. You can measure the degree to which your company is highly performing (or not). So look to set the stage for a great culture and then measure your progress. Solidifying your culture means you’ll have less to worry about as you move toward spending more of your time outside your company. Your company culture can be a catalytic mechanism for you. I work with clients to measure the degree to which they have a high-performance culture (or not) by doing a general Culture Survey or by doing Leadership 360 Surveys on a group of key leaders. Doing this is essential because you’re given raw data. Your team of leaders can argue all day long about how people perceive your company culture to be, but no one can argue with the data. So put perception (and often wishful thinking) aside and measure your company’s culture. Only then can you be strategic about knowing what to do to build an even higher level of overall performance.\nYour culture is a catalytic mechanism simply because competitors have a very hard time copying a culture. They can copy a product, a service, a gizmo, or whatever. But there are plenty of business examples that demonstrate how very hard it is to copy a viable, high-performance company culture.\nUse the power of your presence. On a more personal note, also recognize that there’s a great deal of power in your presence as a CEO. Most CEOs I work with don’t ask for this but it’s a truth nonetheless. Your mere presence, your words, your actions, your smile, your demeanor—all of these serve to inspire those around you toward higher levels of performance…or not. Focus on nurturing the talent you have while building a strong productive culture. Paula Marshall Chapman, CEO of Bama, calendars in ‘walking the shop floor’ because she sees the strategic value of connecting with the people within her company.\nBottom line: When you’re in the office, work to get out of your office. Walk around; connect; talk; share; and smile. Be a resource for your leaders; be accessible. Hold your executive leaders to higher standards and accountabilities around these same endeavors.\nAnalyze any gaps (current or potential) that you see. Based on your company’s strategic intent, what’s working well, and why? What’s not working, and why? What’s a potential roadmap for filling the gaps? What resources (which includes your people) are needed to expedite a solution? Where does there seem to be a lack of clarity around expectations? What key internal functions need to operate at a higher level so that margins are increased? What results do you need to see that you aren’t seeing? At what revenue inflection points will we need to hire new people (and in what positions)?\nFocus on your people. Who is an underperformer that you need to have a talk with about expectations? Use this time to frame that conversation (and then have the conversation). Who needs your expertise, and how can you share that expertise? Part of this blends with “Creating your future org chart” from area #1 presented earlier in this blog.\nTake a Deep Dive. Another suggestion for using this 15% of your time is to take a deeper dive into understanding a core issue or challenge your company is having. By pausing to reflect and think, you give yourself the space to think more clearly. A new set of questions will emerge as you study and research a given area, as you allow yourself to ponder and entertain alternative ideas, and you’ll be extending your knowledge as well. If you don’t give yourself the time to pause and reflect, you’ll be forever caught up in the rat race. As the comedian Lily Tomlin once said, “The trouble with the rat race is that in the end, you’re still a rat.” So get out of the rat race and permit yourself to take the time and space to think…something…through.\nCEOs Should Spend 15% of Their Time on Strategic Leadership Mindset\n(i.e., self-reflection, self-edification, mindfulness, planning, and thinking)\nNOTE: If there’s time left from one of the above, it goes here.\nFor instance:\nStay smart. In short, read. Read blogs, read books, read articles. I had dinner with Daniel Pink a few years ago, and he noted that he purposefully reads magazines that are outside his given profession (such as Oprah) because he will read something that suddenly sparks his thinking about how to see a business challenge differently, or a tidbit will jolt his thinking on a key concept, etc. Warren Buffet believes that consistent reading is how knowledge builds upon itself, much like compound interest. Elon Musk is adamant about reading. Bill Gates, known for his firm belief that CEOs should have a regular rhythm for reading, affirms the notion of getting comfortable with whatever you’re reading: Write in the margins, draw arrows and stars, and turn down the corners of pages.\nAccording to Tom Corley, author of Change Your Habits, Change Your Life, 88% of financially successful people read at least 30 minutes a day. If you select a book, just chip away at it by reading ‘x’ number of pages a day. Don’t know which book to start with? Try Corley’s book noted above or The Wisdom of Crowds by James Surowiecki, or A Whole New Mind by Daniel Pink, or Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown, or Orbiting the Giant Hairball by Gordon MacKenzie, or Leaders Eat Last by Simon Sinek, or Rhythm: How to Achieve Breakthrough Execution and Accelerate Growth by Patrick Thean, or Predictable Results: How Successful Companies Tackle Growth Challenges and Win (co-authored by myself and my fellow consultants at Rhythm Systems). If you need more, just let me know…\nDon’t work on airplanes. Give yourself a break by not working on airplanes, treat it as \"you\" time, not work time. Instead, use the time to relax, read a magazine, thumb through a book, play video games, or watch a movie. In short: Chill! Phil Libin, the former CEO of Evernote, put it this way when interviewed by The Washington Post: “Like everyone else, I used to just work on airplanes—I'd use that as a time to catch up on things. And [then] I stopped. I said when I'm on a plane, I won't work. I'll read, I'll play video games, I'll sleep, I'll watch movies, but I don't work. It makes me look forward to flying. I can get off a long flight, and be kind of relaxed.\" If you're a mid-market CEO you probably don't take all of your vacation days, so use this time to relax and unwind. The average CEO works 9.7 hours per weekday and at least one weekend day.\nGet an Executive Coach. In a study by the International Coaching Federation, in consultation with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and the Association Resource Centre, Inc., the mean ROI of executive coaching was 7 times the initial investment, and over a quarter of coaching clients reported a stunning ROI of 10 to 49 times the cost. There’s a domino effect when you expedite your decision-making or when you improve your business sense and expertise as a leader. Learning how to lead differently catapults your ability to influence more productive behaviors of those around you.\nThe focus of Executive Coaching is on you as an individual in a business context. The emphasis is placed on increasing your effectiveness, thereby producing meaningful action. An Executive Coach will simply get you where you want to be quicker. A strong Executive Coach is good at truth-telling, (i.e., I remind my clients that as an Executive Coach, it’s my job to tell them what others might not want to tell them). As one CEO coachee recently said to me (after a bit of a pause), “You’re direct,” …another pause… “I really like that.” I smiled and said to him, “Glad you appreciate that because…it’s my job.”\nAn Executive Coach serves to help you gain clarity in your thinking, helps you wade through all the options you might have for dealing with a specific situation, serves to provide alternative perspectives around all the multiple components of growing a company, and helps you lead yourself toward your preferred future (so you’ll be spending your time as you should), jump-starts your thinking, and holds you accountable to your own Leadership Path of Progress.\nThe CEO Golden Formula, then, is “40-30-15-15”\nGetting to 40-30-15-15 takes a while; you can’t just flip a switch and be there. But you can start working toward maximizing your time so you aren’t working horrendous hours because you’re spending your time in worthless meetings or because you’re involved in too many internal operations. The company is more than just you and needs to operate that way. Start your journey today toward gaining control of your company while also reclaiming a bit of your focus of control (and sanity). Think about how you have spent your time over the previous 90 days. How close were you to the golden formula? How much more effective could you have been if you had used this CEO time management framework?\nSmart leaders don’t lead alone.

    "domain": "intercom.com",
    "age": "1,381 days ago",
    "content": "The idea behind the funnel is quite simple – marketers craft campaigns to capture potential customers’ attention and slowly nurture them until they are ready to be handed off to the sales team, which guides them through the purchasing stage until they become paying customers and, hopefully, loyal advocates.\nBut the funnel is failing marketers, salespeople, customer success agents, and frankly, customers. It doesn’t take into account third-party review sites, peer-to-peer recommendations, or word-of-mouth; the handover process is messy and puts teams at odds with each other, and more often than not, it rewards high quarterly numbers rather than providing a good customer experience. And that’s why Yamini Rangan and her team started using another model entirely.\nYamini is a tech industry veteran with over 25 years of experience. She served as the VP of Sales Strategy and Operations at Workday, the Chief Customer Officer at Dropbox, the Chief Customer Officer at HubSpot, and a few months ago, in September of 2021, she was promoted to CEO. Passionate about customer-centricity, Yamini believes the key to sustainable growth is customer retention and aligning all teams around the customer – and for her, the Flywheel model is just a better metaphor for how today’s organizations interact with customers and how they can drive business growth.\nIn today’s episode, Intercom’s Chief Marketing Officer Anna Griffin chats with Yamini about customer engagement, the Flywheel approach, and how it helps organizations gain momentum by delivering a remarkable customer experience. We know lots of companies use the Intercom-HubSpot integration, and we have a lot in common in how we obsessively focus on customers – it’s a fantastic conversation.\nShort on time? Here are a few key takeaways:\n- While the funnel model can lead to a disconnected CX, the Flywheel’s holistic approach enables teams to work together to attract, engage, and delight customers.\n- The speed of the Flywheel increases when you add force to areas that have the most impact on the customer’s success, and it decreases with any point of friction in the customer journey.\n- Chances are that customers have done their research on your business. Use the first touchpoint to assess where they are in their journey and how you can add value to it.\n- Instead of just focusing on typical sales metrics such as ACV or number of leads, look at metrics that customers are impacted by, such as how many customers upgrade after engaging with a trial.\n- You need both quantitative and qualitative data to understand customers and their experiences. Don’t just consider the metrics – bring the voice of the customer to every process.\nIf you enjoy our discussion, check out more episodes of our podcast.

What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the episode.\nThe road to HubSpot\nAnna Griffin: Yamini, welcome to the show. We are so delighted to have you with us today. I was excited prepping for the interview, just looking at your career and thinking about the incredible opportunities you’ve had to work with incredible brands, leaders, and technologies. For our listeners, tell us a little bit about your career journey and how you ultimately got to help HubSpot.\nYamini Rangan: Anna, thank you so much for having me on your podcast. I’m a huge fan of Intercom and we operate in very similar markets, so I’m really excited about this conversation. I started as an engineer – at that point, I was fascinated by technology. Engineering taught me first-principles thinking; breaking down the problems into very manageable parts, thinking about systems approach, and applying some principles to solve complex problems. That’s what I took away from my engineering career.\nThen I went to business school, and I found myself in tech sales. That was not an intentional choice. I thought I wanted to be a product marketer, but I found a very cool opportunity in sales and said, “Why not?” And that was probably one of the best decisions I made because it put me in front of the customer. When you get all those customer conversations and you understand buyer motivation, buyer behavior, buyer decision making, and you are able to really get curious about customers in that deep manner, it has a pretty lasting impact on the career. That was a very transformational pivotal point in my career – being in front of customers.\n“I aspired to do something great, but I did not aspire to be a CEO of a public company of the nature of HubSpot”\nI spent the last decade scaling businesses at Workday and Dropbox before coming to HubSpot. Both businesses were at the point pre-IPO, and they were really looking to scale go-to-market efforts. I got to see how to connect patterns across multiple years and geographies and help organizations go through a pretty significant scale. That’s what brought me to HubSpot. HubSpot is a phenomenal company. It’s very customer-centric and obsessed with buyer behavior and trends. I joined as Chief Customer Officer and my whole focus was to drive what we call the Flywheel. Now, a year later, I’m the CEO of the company. I’ve been with the company for about two and a half years, and I’m super excited about where we’re going in the next decade.\nAnna Griffin: Making that transition from product, to sales, to Chief Customer Officer or even business transformation and scaling initiatives – how does one make that transition to CEO? But you already answered it. That is the magic pivot. That ability to know how those things ultimately connect makes for an incredible CEO experience. You become the CEO of HubSpot, what was that like? Literally, you’re told you’re getting the job – what’s your first instinct?\nYamini Rangan: Exceptionally emotional, partly because of my journey. Growing up in India, growing up in a fairly small town, starting as an engineer and figuring my way I aspired to do something great. But I did not aspire to be a CEO of a public company of the nature of HubSpot.\nI was also somewhat overwhelmed because HubSpot is one of those incredibly iconic companies. Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah started it about 15 ago, and they’ve built a truly amazing company with great culture, focus on customers, and focus on crafted solutions. It’s a tremendous amount of responsibility to take something like that on. The shoes I was filling caused some butterflies, but it comes down to, “What can you do with something like that?” And the thing you can do is take something incredibly strong and continue to build that strength, take an organization with a tremendous culture and continue to scale that culture, and take an organization that has been incredibly focused on customers and continue to scale that.\nThe Flywheel Model\nAnna Griffin: You said something earlier that I wanted to go back to and that was the Flywheel. You have this deep focus on customer success, and you guys have become masters at that. Tell us more about the Flywheel advocate approach.\nYamini Rangan: Before we understand the Flywheel, you have to understand why we need the Flywheel. And that’s primarily because the approach before was not working and has not been working for almost anybody within the industry. And that’s the funnel – we call it the funnel vision. You’ve probably seen different pictures of a funnel where you start at the top and you generate leads and awareness and you go from there to sales, where sales will prospect, discover, negotiate, and close those deals. Then, there is some kind of bell that rings because you win the customer.\n“It puts teams in conflict with each other versus what they should be focused on – the customer. It’s not what the handoff looks like, it’s who they’re serving”\nThere are a bunch of issues with that type of funnel vision. First off, it puts marketing, sales, and customer success at odds. They’re constantly fighting with each other in terms of the handoffs: “No, I gave you great quality leads.” “No, you did not give me enough quality leads.” “Well, you didn’t select the right customers.” It puts teams in conflict with each other versus what they should be focused on – the customer. It’s not what the handoff looks like, it’s who they’re serving.\nThere is something fundamentally wrong with that type of funnel vision, so we came up with the Flywheel: you put the customer at the center, you attract, you engage, and you delight those customers so they go from “I’m not aware of you as a company” to “I like you and I’ll buy a product” to “I’m delighted by you, and I’m going to advocate for you.” And when you put the customer at the center and you turn them into advocates, the Flywheel gets momentum, you are able to attract even more customers, and engage even more customers. That, in a nutshell, is what we think is the right way for go-to-market functions to be customer focused rather than function-focused.\nAnna Griffin: That’s so important, particularly in a world where net revenue retention is the number one driver of enterprise value. How to drive more customer retention is on everyone’s mind. Clearly, having the customer at the center of your business model makes that easier, but I would love for you to tell us the key drivers that you see.\nYamini Rangan: One thing I really like is that the question focuses on customer retention. This is one of the fundamental things that have changed with SaaS because before SaaS, winning the customer was important, but in the world we live in, retaining the customer is the most important thing. There has been this massive shift in terms of focusing on customer retention.\nI’m not going to tell you anything fundamentally different about how you drive that type of customer attention. It starts with, “Are you attracting and engaging the right customers? Once they sign up as the customer, are you onboarding them right? Are you providing enough support so they can engage with the product? And are you delivering ongoing value?” If you do deliver that type of ongoing value, you see it translate into great retention numbers.\nGoing back to our Flywheel, what are the things that will fuel the Flywheel and continue to drive that type of retentive motion versus what are the points of friction that will take energy away from the Flywheel, that will reduce your retention and reduce the value that you’re delivering to customers? That’s how we think about it. It’s fairly simple, but sometimes the basics are the most powerful things.\n“The winning aspiration for that team is delivering delightful customer experiences – it’s not a marketing aspiration or sales aspiration, it’s a customer aspiration”\nAnna Griffin: I’m imagining almost like a map or a diagram that shows every point of friction that must be removed or could become a hindrance. Do you ever graph your Flywheel?\nYamini Rangan: I think you’re talking about a customer journey map of some kind. That type of visualization is what we all aim to do. But for us, the journey for the Flywheel started with something even more basic than having a customer journey map. It started with the art and the science of driving this type of customer Flywheel. I start with the art piece because frankly, art is culture. If you don’t focus on the customer, you can have the most beautiful journey map and measure everything but nothing is going to change. Our cultural values start with solving for the customer. That’s literally the mantra we have, the north star we have. Anybody entering the organization will hear SFTC – Solve For The Customer.\nNow, it doesn’t stop there. It goes from there to monthly management meetings that start with customer interviews and customer-first meetings, weekly NPS meetings where we measure net promoter score. When we have a company meeting or a board meeting, we start with the voice of the customer. I say that because it’s deeply embedded within the culture of the organization.\nThe science part of it is quite different. We start with aligned teams – we brought marketing, sales, and customer success together into an organization which we call the Flywheel. Then, we created a strategy that was customer-focused. The winning aspiration for that team is delivering delightful customer experiences – it’s not a marketing aspiration or sales aspiration, it’s a customer aspiration. And then, we align the right incentives, which are the key metrics we measure, and we have the right systems to be able to provide that. Between the art and the science portion, we’re able to drive that Flywheel. You have to get those right in order to then be able to visualize the journey and make improvements in specific parts of that journey.\nEngaging with customers at the right time\nAnna Griffin: Fascinating. We share very similar thinking. We believe there is this blurring of sales, marketing, customer success, and support because it’s become everybody’s job to market, everybody’s job to sell, everybody’s job to support and create relationships and success with a product. It’s everybody’s job to engage with the customer. It can’t just be put in silos. I’d love to hear your philosophy on modern-day engagement. What does that look like at HubSpot?\nYamini Rangan: It’s fascinating. May I ask you a question? How do you think of engagement at Intercom? I’m very fascinated by this.\nAnna Griffin: Well, for so long, particularly in digital businesses now, it’s been very one-way, and there have been very few opportunities for real two-way engagement. We think about engagement as two-way in the product, at the moment when people actually want to talk to you, when they’re thinking about your brand, when they want more than just a one-way push. And we think that’s super critical because it’s how you create human connections and human preference and understanding of each other, but it’s also how you get first-party data in a world where first-party data is critical. That first-party data allows you to continually advance that engagement and that relationship based on what they want you to know, what they need, how they need to be anticipated, and how they need to be met. So that’s how we think about it at Intercom.\n“We think about engagement as buyer empowerment rather than seller productivity”\nYamini Rangan: I love it, and that’s exactly right. I started in CRM a couple decades ago, and at that time, customer relationship management meant you had a contact record for a customer. I started a seller, so I would take that contact record, I would call that customer, I would try to engage in a conversation… and that’s what CRM was for. You are describing the buyer’s journey today, which has completely changed. The buyer has so much more access to information. They could go to your website and look at your product. They could download a free product and engage with your product. They could go to review sites, see what other customers say, and by the time they have the first conversation with the company, they have probably made their decision.\nThe notion of engagement is that just-in-time engagement you are just talking about. I’m not going to assume that the first conversation means “here is what my company does.” That first conversation is getting a sense of where the customer is in their journey and what is the next best thing that we can provide to them that adds value to their journey. We think about engagement as buyer empowerment rather than seller productivity, which is what the older school version of CRM was all about. I think it’s shifted pretty significantly.\nAnna Griffin: I think you’re dead-on when you talked about the time of it. My children asked, “Mom, what do you do? Help me understand what Intercom does. I don’t get it.” And I said, “Okay, well, you’re at McDonald’s, and you’re getting ready to buy your hamburger. When do you want to talk about French fries? In an email you receive two days later after you’ve left McDonald’s? That’s not the time to talk about French fries. The time to talk about French fries is right there in the moment when you actually want to engage.” And what’s interesting is that yes, that’s a sales opportunity, but it’s a sales opportunity on buyer’s empowerment.\nYamini Rangan: Correct.\nAnna Griffin: You have to be there when they want to talk about it; when they have the issue, when they have a need, and ultimately when you have an opportunity.\nCustomer in, not function out\nAnna Griffin: How would we get started with a Flywheel approach in our business?\nYamini Rangan: I mean, you can certainly go all in and create the art and the science behind it. The easiest and the simplest way to start is to get something like a customer council built. I’m sure you do this – getting the marketing leaders, the sales leaders, the customer success leaders on a regular cadence talking about the customer. The first step is to go from functional thinking to customer thinking. We say this is like customer in rather than function out.\nIn order for you to take that step of thinking through the lens of the customer, you have to create a customer council of some sort, bring the leaders across marketing, sales, and customer success, look at metrics that customers will be impacted by – not the number of leads or the ACV, but how many customers visited this website, how many customers are engaging with our free product and how many customers are getting value out of it so that they look at upgrading. Think about the metrics from a customer perspective. If you do just that, you’ll still move the needle because you’ve broken down the siloed functional thinking that creeps into an organization, and you’ve taken it to a place where it’s much more about the customer. That’s the first step.\n“When you just look at numbers, you don’t understand what’s happening with that particular customer persona”\nAnna Griffin: Yeah. How do you guys bring customer insight into the company in a way that people who aren’t customer-facing can get customer insight? Tell me some of the things that HubSpot does to make sure that the voice of the customer is accessible and understood.\nYamini Rangan: The voice of the customer cannot be one and done. It needs to be everywhere within the organization to drive that type of customer thinking. We have a voice of the customer program and team, and that team’s accountability is to bring both quantitative and qualitative data about customers and their experiences. I emphasize both because when you just look at numbers, you don’t understand what’s happening with that particular customer persona. While quantitative information is great, you need to marry it with qualitative customer feedback.\nEarlier, I mentioned our customer-first meeting. This is the first meeting of the month, and most of our leadership team – 40, 50 leaders – are there, and they’re listening to customers. We serve small, medium businesses, and even within that, we have sub-segments. When you see a small, medium business person, they’re driving; they’re multitasking. They have a kid behind that they’re helping. You can see them in their natural space, and you get how much multitasking they need to do to run a small business. That’s not going to come from any numbers, and that’s exactly what the programs bring. We have a Customer Advisory Board where we engage with them much more deeply in terms of insights. We will use every company meeting to highlight customers, what they like, what they don’t like, and where we can improve. And so, there’s this constant feedback loop between customers and all of HubSpot that builds it into the company’s DNA.\nAnna Griffin: That’s fantastic. Before we wrap, I do want to ask you, what’s the future of HubSpot? What are you going to be able to make possible next? What are you most excited about?\nYamini Rangan: I love that question. I’m really excited. We’re in the middle of a transformation. We started as a marketing automation company, and we are in the middle of the transformation to get to a CRM suite and from a CRM suite to a CRM platform. Providing crafted solutions to customers across marketing, sales, customer success, and support to enable this Flywheel is a huge opportunity that customers in small, and medium businesses need. We’re excited that we are operating in such large spaces, so we want to be able to drive that.\n“We’re certainly seeing an acceleration in digital transformation over the last couple of years, but this is just the beginning”\nWe also care a lot about the culture and we care a lot about diversity, inclusion, and belonging. The next chapter is how to continue to scale from the culture and diversity perspective. The market potential is huge. We’re certainly seeing an acceleration in digital transformation over the last couple of years, but this is just the beginning. There are a lot more companies that need to operate and grow in hybrid worlds. I think the next chapter is even bigger than the previous one.\nAnna Griffin: I can’t wait to see what you’re going to make possible next. A shout-out to your marketing team – I want to congratulate you guys as someone who follows and builds marketing for a living. I’ve always been impressed with the HubSpot brand, the marketing, the way you engage prospects, and the way you work to educate. It’s really world-class.\nYamini Rangan: Thank you so much, Anna. I really appreciate it. Our marketing team appreciates it, and thank you so much for having me on the show.\nWe’ve also had Brian Halligan, HubSpot co-founder and Yamini’s predecessor as CEO, on the show before – you can listen to that episode here.",

    "content": "In the modern business world, few ideas are more important than growth. Even long-time stock market fixtures like McDonald's and General Motors are judged by their quarterly growth rates. And a failure to grow can be catastrophic.\nBut for younger companies - and particularly startups - there's an equally strong fixation on scale.\nHow can a business not just grow, but grow exponentially?\nIn many cases, this is putting the cart before the horse. Young startups need to build a product, create a strong brand identity, and establish a market, and then they can think about hypergrowth.\nBut we'll talk more about this shortly.\nIn this article, we'll explore the differences between growth and scaling. We'll also dive into some key challenges for scaling companies, and what companies need to do to achieve that insane growth.\nGrowth vs scaling up\nLet's begin with the most common distinction between these two terms. In general, we think of growth in linear terms: a company adds new resources (capital, people, or technology), and its revenue increases as a result.\nBy contrast, scaling is when revenue increases without a substantial increase in resources. Processes \"that scale\" are those that can be done en masse without extra effort - if I send an email to 10 people or 1 million, my effort is essentially the same. Which is why enterprises use email marketing so heavily. It scales so effectively. (Check out these SaaS email marketing templates for examples.)\nOr for another example - an insurance company that scaled business operations by simply switching to a cloud business phone system.\nBut this is just the technical distinction between the two words. Let's look a little closer at what each looks like in practice.\nGrowing a business\nGenerally seen as the definition of a successful company, growth refers to increasing revenue as a result of being in business. It can also refer to other aspects of the enterprise that are growing, like its number of employees, the amount of offices and how many clients it serves — these things are almost always linked to growth of revenue.\nThe biggest problem, however, is that it takes a lot of resources to sustain constant growth.\nTake for example an advertising agency that currently has five clients, but which is about to take on five more clients. Increasing the number of companies it sells to will bring in more money, but chances are it won’t be able to get the work done without hiring more people.\nBecause of this, financial growth can only be achieved while making larger losses, too.\nCompanies that offer professional services, like the advertising agency above, will always have to deal with this problem. Taking on more clients leads to hiring more people to support them — while it increases revenue by adding clients, it has to increase costs at the same time.\nScaling a business\nBecause of the costs associated with growth, modern founders have become obsessed with the idea of scaling.\nThe key difference with growth is that scale is achieved by increasing revenue without incurring significant costs. While adding customers and revenue exponentially, costs should only increase incrementally, if at all.\nThe difference between growth and scaling becomes most clear when a company isn’t a startup anymore, but is not a large corporation yet, either. At this critical stage the business will have to decide between growing at a regular rate or switching over to faster company scaling.\nIf it wants a shot at making a lasting impact on the industry and perhaps even society as a whole, it has to be done without accumulating a high amount of overhead.\nUnfortunately there’s no clear-cut path to successful scaling — if there was, it would be much less impressive to build a million-dollar company. There are a couple of things to keep in mind, however.\nFurther reading for startups!\nStartups vs scaleups\nHere we have two more terms that are often confused. You probably already have a firm grasp on what a startup is, but how does that compare with a scaleup?\nAccording to Scaleup Nation, a scaleup is \"an entrepreneurial venture that has achieved product-market fit and now faces either the 'second valley of death' or exponential growth.\"\nTo put that another way, once a startup has proven that it has a product people want, it's time to take that product to the masses. This usually requires massive investment in new people, offices in different markets, and lots of advertising in the form of hosting educational webinars, attending trade shows, prospecting leads, and other tactics.\nWhich actually sounds sort of counter to our earlier definition of \"scaling\" - increasing revenue without increasing investment. But if successful, a scaleup will add exponential growth with only linear or marginal investment. Essentially, if they can unlock new markets and reach new audiences, a scaleup will grow faster than previously possible.\nKey challenges for scaleups\nRecent studies have shown a few trends that should perhaps worry CEOs. First, two-thirds of the fastest-growing companies fail. You might think that reaching hypergrowth status puts you on the inevitable path to success. It appears not.\nOther macro studies have shown that slow-growing companies tend to do better in the long run than their fast-growing counterparts.\nThis is not to suggest that you shouldn't want to grow quickly. But you need to do it smartly. You need to be one of the good ones.\nLet's imagine a business moving from startup to scaleup overnight. What was previously a local company with around 50 people in one cozy office is now a business expanding internationally.\nThe plan is to double in size every twelve months. So in three years, you're going from 50 to 400 full time employees. And some grow a lot faster than that.\nSo what are the key difficulties that come from this kind of scale up?\nYou need investment\nThis is the most obvious prerequisite: today, most young companies need significant investment (usually from venture capitalists) to scale up. This often comes in the form of series B or C funding.\nEarlier funding rounds are used for MVP development and to establish market fit, and if they're able to secure further funding, it's to expand quickly.\nYou need scalable processes\nTypical scaleups have a product that scales well - it appeals to buyers far greater than the current market served. But, because they've moved quickly as a startup, a lot of internal processes aren't designed to scale.\nThe most obvious of these are company expense policies. As a small company, you don't really need an expense policy. If someone needs to travel or buy something, they can sort it out with the founders directly. But once you have multiple offices and handfuls of people traveling at once, this is simply no longer an option.\nYou have to embed a company culture\nStartup company culture tends to come naturally. Again, everyone sits in the same room, you hire carefully, and most of your team has the same goals and passions.\nBut once you move international, this is much harder to control. You don't have the same intimacy with new team members, and they can't feed off the energy and values of the current team as easily.\nFor this reason, scaleups need to think extra carefully about their employee onboarding strategy. This is the best opportunity to share the company vision, embed the core values, and make sure that new hires are a perfect fit.\nEmployees need autonomy; managers need control\nThis should be a guiding theme for all businesses, but it's especially true in the awkward teenage scaleup phase. Managers and HR teams suddenly have far less visibility over their team members, and they need to be able to trust that they're conducting business appropriately.\nAnd team members find it harder than ever to get help from management and HR, with so many new hires to worry about. And again, they may not even be on the same continent!\nThis dynamic is tricky without good scaleup software. Online payroll tools, spend management, and productivity systems can all help to decentralize information, while centralizing control.\nHow to scale a business\nIt's impossible to provide that one \"secret\" to make your company scale exponentially rather than grow. But for those looking for clues and tips, here's some good guidance.\nAberdeen - Invest in company culture\nWith scale comes an influx of new talent. Which is great! But most startup leaders spend years carefully building a cohesive company culture, and you need to be sure not to let it slip away.\n\"When you are scaling, core values can get lost or muddled. Renewing your dedication to those values will attract the best talent, help you obtain the best technology for analyzing and managing your financial data, and clearly define how to continue to scale.\"\nYokelLocal - Fire yourself from the little things\nIf the plan is to scale, you'll have to let go of most of the little things that eat up your time. Founders, CFOs, and other leaders need to stop thinking about saving every little penny, and focus on the bigger picture.\n\"Just get someone! You’ll most likely find that they are better and more efficient than you at these tasks anyway.\nGuess what? Now you can spend your time on the portion of the business that requires your appropriate skill set - the stuff that you are truly good at!\"\nStartups.co.uk - Invest in process management\nSimilar to outsourcing, process management requires you to leave the small things to others. The important factors here are to make sure that processes are documented, and that others can pick them up without having to be shown step-by-step.\n\"As a small business owner you probably have direct lines of communication to all of your employees. But as your business develops you must turn your attention to strategic questions and leave the day-to-day operations of your business to others.\"\nGrow, scale, succeed\nHopefully this article has helped to demystify the nuances around growth and scaling. In truth, both are important and the difference for companies is often a matter of timing.\nBut as we've seen, there are clear steps businesses can take to prepare themselves for the scaleup phase. Establish clear (digitized) processes, make information readily available from anywhere, and try not to rely on one-to-one communication for anything important.\nFrom there, successful scaling is part planning, part effort, and plenty of good luck!\nCurious how Spendesk works?\nTry an interactive demo to see spend control and approvals end-to-end.\nGet a free tour",

    "content": "Written by Patrick Thean | Thu, Jan 6, 2022 @ 01:27 AM\nI was in Jakarta speaking at Taipan 2013. We had the strongest showing at Taipan ever with 220 people! CEOs with their teams worked hard on their business. I had a wonderful time. EO Indonesia and EO Malaysia were such wonderful hosts, making the event very memorable. My one-day session on Rockefeller Habits (Scaling Up) and the One-Page Strategic Plan template was adjusted for two different types of teams in the audience: teams being introduced to this framework and experienced teams who wanted to take it further.\nI focused on using the One Page Strategic Plan as a purposeful and actionable tool and shared 7 keys to using this wonderful framework to execute and grow:\n7 tips on using the Rockefeller Habits\nI focused on using the One Page Strategic Plan as a purposeful and actionable tool and shared 7 keys to using this wonderful framework to execute and grow:\n- Core Values that drive Execution\n- Purpose and BHAG to provide Direction and Focus\n- Brand Promise to Win the Right Customers\n- Winning Moves to 2X your Company\n- Execution Plan every quarter with Clear Priorities\n- Leading Indicators to Drive Results\n- “Do” Rhythm for Critical Adjustments\nThe One-Page Strategic Plan is a wonderfully simple tool to document all your strategic as well as execution decisions. Let's get everyone to execute off the same page, and yes, here is the link.\n1. Core Values that drive Execution: Don't allow your core values to be merely a poster on the wall. Use them purposefully every day. Don't be tempted to hire that great resource who does not demonstrate your core values. Allow your core values to be your veto tool. Hire and fire by your core values. Here's a tip to live your core values: Choose words that you use daily. Don't switch to \"corporate speak\" when you bring up your core values. To make it stick, it's got to be the way you talk with each other.\n2. Purpose and BHAG to provide Direction and Focus: Use your purpose and BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) to provide a long-term focus for your team. Your BHAG is a 10+ year goal. Use it to get your team on an exciting journey. Your future is bright. Capture it in your BHAG and Purpose. Allow the excitement of the future to focus on your team and pull them into the future. It will be easier to decide which priorities are critical and which priorities are less important in the long term when you have your BHAG clearly in focus, with a strong purpose, making decisions every day.\n3. Brand Promise to Win the Right Customers: Your brand promise should be matched with a guarantee that makes you stand out from your competition and provide a compelling value proposition to the type of customer you want to attract. You don't need to attract everybody. You only need to attract your core customers. This is the group of customers who have the characteristics that make your service or product compelling for them, as well as pleasurable for your team to service. Test your brand promise. If it does not attract the right customers and help you close deals faster, you can probably do better!\n4. Winning Moves to 2X your Company: Column 3 on your One Page Strategic Plan has a block for you to document your Key Thrusts for the next 3-5 years. Here is a mistake I see many companies make. They forget to brainstorm and include a couple of growth strategies. I call these 3-5 strategic growth plans Winning Moves. Instead, I see key thrusts like Growing our leadership team; Improving our infrastructure; Improve our internal processes. Nothing against those key thrusts. They are good, too. But, you need to make sure that you have at least 2 Winning Moves to grow revenue. Revenue growth does not happen automatically. And if you do not have a couple of Winning Moves in your key thrusts block, you might hit the growth wall in a few years.\n5. Execution Plan every quarter with Clear Quarterly Rocks: Many companies I visit these days have quarterly execution plans. That's great! That's the right side of your One Page Strategic Plan. It is so important that we dedicated half the One-page Strategic Plan to getting you aligned on the Execution Plan for the quarter. Here's the thing, for companies with more than 50 employees or associates, you also need to extend or cascade this planning process to your departments and teams. Your plan is not complete until your departments and teams also have their execution plan for the quarter that is aligned and linked back to the company plan.\n6. Leading Indicators to Drive Results: At the top of your One Page Strategic Plan are six categories of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). Think of this as your balanced scorecard and health indices for your company. Results indicators like revenues and profits are important to keep track of, but not what I suggest you put up here. Behind every result is typically a leading indicator that lets you peek into the future, and gives you an indication if you are on the right track to achieving the results that you want. Work to discover 1 or 2 leading indicators for the six categories at the top of your One-page Strategic Plan (Employees, Customers, Shareholders, Make/Buy, Sell, and Keeping Records).\n7. “Do” Rhythm for Critical Adjustments: This is my favorite part. I like to say \"Learning is good, but doing is much, much better!\" You have 13 weeks to achieve your plan for the quarter. Think of it as a 13-week race. And every week is one leg of your race. The key lesson is to make the right adjustments when you notice that your leading indicator tells you that you are not on track to achieve your goals. Your weekly meeting rhythm of reviewing priorities and KPIs will allow you to catch issues earlier in the quarter, giving you more time to figure it out and come up with corrective actions.\nLooking for more information? This One Page Strategic Plan (OPSP) is designed to help you and your team align around a shared vision and execute with clarity and focus. Use this streamlined tool to ensure everyone is on the same page and working towards common goals.",

    "age": "1,381 days ago",
    "content": "My mission with this post is twofold:\n- To convince you that having a personal mission statement is a good move.\n- To help you start writing up with a personal mission statement that doesn’t make people’s eyes roll when you tell it to them.\nIt’s an ambitious mission.\nThe first hurdle is to help you overcome the common (and well-deserved) perception that personal mission statements are corny nonsense—the type of ineffective self-helpism that desperately bored housewives and unfulfilled middle managers fiddle with. “Successful” people are too busy being successful to bother.\nThen, if you manage to clear that first hurdle, this post aspires to help you avoid falling into the trap that follows it: writing a useless, cliché, meaningless personal mission statement like, “To inspire others to achieve great things,” or, “To positively impact the life of every person I encounter.”\nLet’s see if you can’t come up with a meaningful and effective personal mission statement that inspires you and others around you instead.\n30-Second Precap\nWriting your personal mission statement is a worthy exercise because even if you move on to some other self-helpishness a week from now, at the very least it gets you to pause and think bigger picture. And if it sticks, you’ll have a clearer sense of direction and meaning to the story of your life—and you’ll go farther in it.\nTo write your personal mission statement, think of what greater good your existence will serve, what obstacle or conflict you’ll have to overcome to achieve it, and what you want your great-great-grandchildren to remember about you. Then put your personal mission statement in the form of a question. Publish it, get moving, and evolve it as you go along.\nWhy Write a Personal Mission Statement?\nReason #1: To go somewhere that matters.\nYou can either float around life aimlessly—getting tugged by others, busily going in circles, or letting the currents of fate take me adrift—or you can purposefully steer in a single direction.\nIf you choose the latter, which you probably do, then having a personal mission statement as your North Star would seem like a wise choice, no?\nWhat’s more, it can:\n- Save you from getting thrown off course by meaningless distractions.\n- Get you back on track whenever you’re hit by life’s inevitable storms.\n- Motivate you to stay sleek and streamlined rather than adding (or lusting after) useless bells and whistles.\nBut what if you pick the wrong direction?\nThat’s a risk. But don’t you think not picking any direction is even riskier?\nReason #2: To deliver better returns.\nEvery successful business has a mission statement.\nYour Life is your business, you’re the CEO until you RIP, and you presumably want it to be a success. So why shouldn’t Your Life have a mission statement, too?\nIt would:\n- Align the various departments in Your Life—finances, R&D, relationships, career, health, etcetera—toward a single long-term mission.\n- Guide your decision-making.\n- Make clear to your stakeholders (friends, family, acquaintances, readers) where you want to go so they know how to help you.\n- Hopefully deliver exceptional returns to your shareholders (your future selves).\nReason #3: Why not?\nBecause it’s hokey self-help-ism?\nWe’re being rational here, not judging, so that’s not a good reason.\nBecause it’s a waste of time?\nYes, it takes time and mental energy, but even if your personal mission statement doesn’t pan out, this big-picture thinking exercise might have value. It’s a strategic time-out in your game of life.\nBecause it’s impossible to encapsulate your life into a single mission?\nMaybe some people can have multiple personal mission statements. But I’d argue that the more focused you are and the less you multi-task, the more progress you’ll make. (See: Reason #2.)\nBecause many successful people don’t seem to need personal mission statements and people who have them rarely seem to succeed?\nThere are a couple of flaws to this argument:\nFirst, maybe successful people could be even more successful if they had personal mission statements. Or maybe they have them and we don’t know. Or maybe they’re not as successful as they appear.\nAnd second, maybe unsuccessful people are more successful than they appear. Maybe how you measure success in life is misguided. Or maybe (likely) their personal mission statements suck and they’re not executing on them well.\nHow to Write a Personal Mission Statement\nCommit yourself.\nIf you expect to come up with a personal mission statement in a matter of minutes (or even hours or days), don’t waste your time reading any further.\nYour North Star isn’t as easy to spot as the actual Polaris. And it will inevitably move around with changes to your life. So it will only help you if you’re committed to honing in on it for the long haul.\nThink of your great-great-grandchildren.\nAsk yourself: What do you want your great-grandchildren to say about you to your great-great-grandchildren who’ll never meet?1This is one of the 10 “GPS” questions to ask yourself to ensure you’re on the right track.\nThis question might help you think big picture and in words that make sense to other people.\nTo give you an example, here’s my answer:\n“You would have liked to have met Great Great Grandpa Chris. He seemed to have cracked the code to life and inspired us all with his independent approach to everything he did.”\nGet angry.\nAsk yourself: What makes you angry?\nThat anger indicates where your values lie and what you won’t get tired of working toward.\nMake it bigger than yourself.\nThe most effective corporate mission statements look beyond the company toward its impact on society.2Mission Statement Quality and Financial Performance concludes that “be responsible to the society in which you do business” is one of three main components of a successful mission statement. And the authors of Effectiveness of Mission Statements in Organizations – A Review write that “mission statement development ought to be directed toward both internal and external stake-holders.” Your personal mission statement should do the same.\nAsk yourself: What greater good can my existence on this planet serve?\nThink of the plot to your life’s story.\nOf all the structures for writing your personal mission statement I’ve found online and in books, my favorite is from this podcast episode by Donald Miller. I like this structure because it sets the plot for living a meaningful life story.\nIt has three steps:\n- Conflict. What problem do you want to take on? (i.e., What makes you angry?)\n- Action. How are you going to solve it?\n- Resolution. What’s the desired result of your mission?\nFor example, here’s Miller’s personal mission statement:\nMany people are searching for a deep sense of meaning [conflict]. I teach a series of frameworks [action] that help them find meaning in their life so work and life are happier [resolution].\nWrite it in the form of a question.\nConsider if we rewrote Miller’s mission as a question instead of a statement:\nHow can I help people understand and apply meaning-finding frameworks that help them be happier in work and life?\nIsn’t that even better?3Hat tip to Warren Berger’s excellent book, A More Beautiful Question for this idea.\nA personal mission statement is more effective in the form of a question because it:\n- Sounds less arrogant and official.\n- Shows that the mission’s in progress rather than being completed.\n- Invites participation and collaboration.\nGet it done.\nPick a direction, get moving, and adjust course along the way rather than sit around waiting for your mission to find you.4See How to Be Extraordinary: The 7 Childishly Simple Rules\nPut it in your face.\nAsk yourself: Where can you plaster your mission statement so you’re consistently reminded of it and use it to better guide your decisions?\nFor example, I’ve added my personal mission statement to the top of my weekly and monthly goals in my lifelogging practice so I see it every day.\nPut it in others’ faces.\nIf you want other people to help you with your mission, you’ve got to make it public.\nUse it as a more interesting answer to the boring question, “What do you do?” Tell it to your friends, family, and first dates to get their feedback on whether or not it’s not gobbledegook and hold yourself accountable to it. And post it on your Twitter, LinkedIn profiles so people know what you’re really about.\nEvolve it.\nI don’t know about you, but my mission statement from 10 years ago would be very different from what it is today. And I bet whatever it is 10 years from now will be different, too.\nFAQ\nHow long does it take to come up with a personal mission statement?\n“A mission statement is not something you write overnight. It takes deep introspection, careful analysis, thoughtful expression, and often many rewrites to produce it in real form,” wrote Steven Covey in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.\nIt’s not a task you complete. It’s an ongoing process. The value comes from going back to it, thinking about it, evolving it, and working towards it.\nWhat’s the definition of a personal mission statement?\nIt’s a personal summary of why you exist: the problem you seek to solve with your life, how you intend to do it, and your vision of what the result of your life will be.\nWhat’s the difference between a personal vision statement and a personal mission statement?\nVision statements are about where you want to go and mission statements are about why you’re going there.\nSome self-helpers say you need one or the other or both.\nMeh.\nOne statement’s enough for me. I think it should have both a vision and a mission. Call it whatever you want.\nHow many words should a personal mission statement be?\nIt should be short enough for someone to understand when you tell it to them, but not as short as most of the other big sites recommend (this, this, and this post, for example). Their personal mission statement examples like, “To be a leader to my team, live a balanced life and make a difference,” or “To inspire others to achieve great things” are too generic, unspecific, uninspiring, and unactionable to be of use.\nBetter to err on the long side to ensure your mission statement includes all the necessary components, then try to trim it down as you go.\nI’m only [your age here] and don’t know myself well enough. What do I do?\nViktor Frankl, author of one of my favorite books, Man’s Search for Meaning, said we detect rather than invent our missions in life.\nSo think of it like you’re using a metal detector. Keep moving, experimenting, exploring, and listening until your mission detector starts beeping so loudly that it’s impossible to ignore.\nThe post I wrote on How to Be Extraordinary has a childishly simple approach to this.\nCan you give me a template?\nSure!\n“I, [Your name here] prefer to take shortcuts in life by using other people’s templates rather than doing the hard work of creating my own life and mission—and personal mission statement—from the ground up.”\nWhat’s your personal mission statement?\nHow can I motivate people to resist complacency and conformity so they experience more rewarding lives?\nWalk the walk.\nI don’t know about you, but I’ve certainly convinced myself more than ever about the value of personal mission statements after all the research and thinking I did to write this.\nAnd hopefully it’s not all talk.\nReciting whatever big words we come up with for our personal mission statements won’t magically make them happen. We have to walk the walk.\nI plan on doing my best.\nWill you?\nMore Resources to Help You Write Your Personal Mission Statement\n- Building a Storybrand Podcast #180: Personal Life Plan.

    "age": "1,381 days ago",
    "content": "When thinking about the most important numbers to measure in your business, most of our clients have no trouble coming up with a list of results they want to achieve. The usual suspects are Revenue, Profit, EBITDA, # of customers, employees, locations, etc. These Result Indicator KPIs are essential - you need to think about the results you want to achieve in your business and set those targets. But don’t stop there! For your key performance indicators to help you solve business problems and reach your goals, you also need to develop Leading Indicator KPIs for business.\nWhat are Leading Indicator KPIs?\nLeading Indicators can help predict what will happen in the future. They let you know if you are on track to achieve your desired results. Leading Indicators are measurable, and you can influence or move them. If you determine and track Leading Indicator KPIs and make adjustments based on those indicators every week, you will have an execution advantage over your competition.\n4-Step Process to Determine Leading Indicator KPIs\nThere’s no magic formula or standard set of Leading Indicators that works for every company. Leading Indicator KPIs only become powerful when you find the right lever to pull, impacting the most important results to your business. While we can’t tell you which leading indicators are most important in your business, we do have a proven process for determining the ones that will work for you:\nLeading Indicator KPI Step 1\nWhen determining Leading Indicator KPIs for your business, it is crucial to identify and clearly define the specific business problem you aim to solve or the opportunity you are looking to maximize. By honing in on the core issue, you can effectively align your key performance indicators with your overarching goals and objectives. This initial step sets the foundation for developing actionable insights and strategies to drive meaningful results and propel your business forward. So, take the time to pinpoint the exact challenge or potential opportunity you are focusing on, as this clarity will guide your entire KPI measurement process and pave the way for success.\nLeading Indicator KPI Step 2:\nWhen clarifying the desired result and setting success criteria on this result KPI, it is essential to make sure that it is SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. By defining your goal this way, you provide a clear, actionable target that can be easily tracked and evaluated. This approach helps align your efforts with your overall objectives and allows for a more focused and effective strategy to achieve your desired results. By establishing SMART criteria for your key performance indicators, you set yourself up for success and ensure that your efforts are directed toward measurable and meaningful outcomes. We use a simple Red-Yellow-Green method.\nLeading KPI Indicator Step 3:\nIt's crucial to delve further into the root cause of the results you want to achieve by asking the right questions. Many individuals overlook the importance of asking probing questions to uncover the underlying Leading Indicators that can drive success. By digging deeper and seeking to understand the factors that influence your desired outcomes, you can identify key metrics that directly impact your business objectives. Don't underestimate the power of thorough questioning in pinpointing the critical drivers of your performance and guiding your strategic decision-making process.\nLeading KPI Indicator KPI Step 4:\nTo ensure that you are driving towards your desired outcomes effectively, it is imperative to establish clear success criteria and regularly monitor your Leading and Results Indicators on a dashboard. By visualizing these key performance metrics, you can easily track your progress, identify any potential issues, and make informed decisions to stay on course. Updating and reviewing this dashboard on a weekly basis allows you to remain proactive in addressing any deviations or challenges, ultimately helping you stay focused and aligned with your business goals. This consistent monitoring and evaluation process will drive results and provide valuable insights for continuous improvement and success.\nMarketing Leading Indicator KPI Example\nOne of the most common business problems we hear about is difficulty achieving predictable results in sales and marketing. To help bring this process to life, here’s an example of how you might create a Leading Indicator KPI:\nLet’s say that you are having a problem with your marketing strategy. You’re just unable to generate the number of sales-qualified leads your sales team needs to hit their quotas.\n-\nThe result you are trying to impact is the number of sales-qualified leads (SQLs) the marketing team can generate monthly. When you look at the data, you can see that your sales team closes 1 out of every 10 SQLs. Their quota for the month is 50 deals closed, so the marketing team needs to provide 500 SQLs for them to hit this number. In order for your sales team to hit their numbers, Your Result KPI with Red-Yellow-Green success criteria might look like this:\n-\n# of SQLs per month\nGreen: 500\nYellow: between Red and Green\nRed: 400\nSuperGreen (stretch goal): 600\n-\n- Next, we need to dig deeper with questions to understand how we can move the needle on the number of sales-qualified leads that marketing pulls in each month. Here are some of the kinds of questions you might ask:\n- What makes a lead well-qualified for sales?\n- Where do most of our SQLs currently come from?\n- Can we do more of what we’re already doing to get more SQLs?\n- What are our potential SQLs reading, or where are they going, that we can get in front of them?\n- Are we offering the right content to attract SQLs to our marketing site?\n- Are we promoting the content in the right places?\n- Are there any trade shows or events where we can have a booth or a speaker to capture SQLs?\n- What are our competitors doing to get SQLs?\nKeep asking questions and digging deeper until you find something that you can measure, influence, and believe will significantly impact the result you are trying to achieve.\nFrom our questions, most of our SQLs come from events like webinars, trade shows, and conferences. If this is how most people ready to buy find us, we might increase the number of marketing events we host or attend to capture more SQLs. Each event typically yields 50 new SQLs for us, so if we participate in 10 monthly events, we can hit our goals.\nOur Leading Indicator KPI Example might look like this:\n# of marketing events per month\nGreen: 10 events/month\nYellow: between Red & Green\nRed: 5 events/month\nSuperGreen: 15 events/month\nWe can create a dashboard where we track the events (the Leading Indicator) and the number of SQLs (the Result) to see if this is the right lever:\nThis example may need to be simplified, but I wanted to illustrate how the process works. The marketing team controls how many events they do to get leads, so this is measurable and movable. They can begin testing this for a quarter to see if pushing on this lever generates the number of leads they need for their sales team to succeed. If moving this Leading Indicator doesn’t have the intended impact on the results, they can go back to the questions in Step 3 and pick a different Leading Indicator to test, such as # of content offers on LinkedIn, # of ads in industry publications, etc.\nLook at your business and pick a problem to tackle this quarter by tracking Leading Indicator KPIs.

    "title": "The Test of True Accountability (Updated for 2023)",
    "domain": "rhythmsystems.com",
    "age": "1,381 days ago",
    "content": "This happens all the time. You are holding someone accountable to get something done. Yet you find yourself checking in and chasing for an update on what is going on. Constantly. And if you do not remind them to report the current status to you, they continue to mosey on and forget about reporting in. So frustrating! But they are supposed to be truly accountable, right? So why are you chasing them around as though you are the one that is really accountable?\nWait… because you are. If you are chasing someone constantly for status updates, then you are actually the one that is truly accountable. Gut check time. Is this happening to you right now? Are you chasing someone to get things done that they are supposedly accountable for?\nI learned an important lesson on team and personal accountability from my first manager at Oracle Corporation. I was with the consulting group in the late 1980s. We designed and developed custom business systems for our clients. Our manager needed us to update our resumes every quarter. This was important as it provided him with the latest and most up to date information on each consultant. This was key to providing the right expertise and experience in order to win competitive bids. We all knew it was important. We all agreed to get our resumes done every quarter. But Jack (I use Jack to protect the true identities of both friends and enemies) had to chase us every quarter to get our resumes done on time. We all cared, but few of us got it done. Finally Jack decided to base our quarterly performance bonus solely on whether we updated our resumes. This represented 10% of our salaries. That quarter, 100% of the consultants got their resumes done on time. Gee… I wonder why.\nThe Accountability Test:\nHere’s the key lesson. While we all cared, Jack felt the most pain when we did not get our resumes done. Jack would remind us every month that it was important to get our resumes updated. We would agree. Jack would share with us how it hurts our department by not having the latest resumes available to sales. We would all agree. But the pain was really Jack’s, and not ours. While we all agreed that we were accountable, we did not feel the impact of any consequences if we did not get our resumes done. It hurt our team’s overall performance, and we all wanted our team to win. Yet while we had the right intentions and agreements, we still did not get this done. Jack cared more about our resumes getting updated than we did. Until Jack found a way to make us care. Until we felt the direct pain of not getting our resumes done. When he transferred real consequences to us (not getting 10% of our salary) we suddenly cared more than Jack. We got accountable. And we got our resumes done. That was when we went from theoretical accountability to true and actual accountability. If you are a manager, and you care more about the job getting done than your team member who is supposed to be accountable, then you still own it. And you are still the one that is practicing true accountability, not your team member. True accountability happens when your team member owns it and feels the pain and consequences of the job not getting done.\nThe Accountability Check:\nIf this story about Jack resonates with you, here are some tips to go from theoretical accountability to true and practical accountability:\n- Identify. Identify the consequences of not getting the job done. Identify who feels the pain when this job is not done right.\n- Ownership. Make sure that the person accountable for the job truly owns it. Find a way to transfer the consequences and pain of failure to the person who is supposed to be accountable. This is ownership.\n- Educate. Make sure your team member understands how he or she is personally affected by not getting the job done on time.\n- Rhythm of updates. Make sure your team member reports status to you on a consistent and regular basis. You should not have to chase them for updates.\nTake the time to help your teammates with true and practical accountability. This will help everyone focus on the right things to get done and stop wasting time chasing after each other to get things done.\nMore DO, less CHASE.\nWant more information on Team Accountability?

    "title": "14 Issues To Prepare For When Your Company Grows Past 50 Employees",

    "age": "1,412 days ago",
    "content": "According to a report by the Small Business Association, 99.9% of companies in the U.S. are small businesses. The same report states that an overwhelming majority of these companies operating across the states employ less than 100 employees.\nAs these businesses grow, it makes sense that their workforce will also expand. Along with this employee growth comes a whole new set of new issues that previously were not a consideration for many companies. Larger workforces demand more, and you need to be proactive in your approach to answer their call.\nBelow, 14 members of Young Entrepreneur Council share some of the issues that you should prepare for when your company passes the 50-employee mark, from health insurance and other benefits to new security risks and training needs.\n1. Employee Benefits\nDepending on the type of role these staff members have, you'll need to explore various types of benefits programs due to the larger size your organization has grown to. This means looking at what type of compliance measures also are required of you now. -Serenity Gibbons, NAACP\n2. Health Insurance\nAccording to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), employers must offer affordable health insurance options to their full-time employees. If you're approaching the 50-employee mark and currently don't offer health insurance, start shopping around for some plans. You can also hire a health insurance broker to shop around for you if you don't have the time. - Jared Atchison, WPForms\n3. Labor Law Compliance\nIn addition to the national requirements, you’ll need to comply with when you cross this threshold, like the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), your state and local governments may have their own regulations based on employee headcount. - Sam Saxton, Paragon Stairs\n4. Standard Operating Procedures\nI find that company systems change every time you double in size. When you go from one person to two people, you often split the work but don’t create systems. At the 50+ employee mark, you really need to think intentionally about how to maintain a cohesive company culture while building in standard operating procedures to help your company function smoothly without you overseeing every aspect. - Lisa Curtis, Kuli Kuli Foods\n5. Specific KPIs For Every Employee\nAs our company grew, we noticed that some employees had more work than others, and sometimes their work even overlapped so two people were doing the same thing. We fixed this by developing key performance indicators (KPIs) for every employee. Now everyone can track how they are performing and it's clear who's responsible for what. - Syed Balkhi, WPBeginner\n6. Implementing Robust Project Management\nWe recently upgraded our project management system to Asana because we seemed to have outgrown our other system. Make sure that you implement a project management system if you don't have one already. It will help keep track of employees' deadlines and assignments to make sure no one is falling behind. - Chris Christoff, MonsterInsights\n7. Harassment Training\nOnce you hit 50 employees you will need to make available required training for sexual harassment. This should be mandatory for every employee and manager, and even the CEO. - Jennifer A Barnes, Pro Back Office, LLC\n8. Ensuring Every Employee Adds Value\nA 50-employee company might not be better than a 10-employee company. While small, build the culture of ensuring every hire directly improves the company. Do not get caught up in the idea that more people can improve the company, without knowing exactly what those new employees will be doing and how much their effort will help grow the business. -Shawn Schulze, HomeArea.com\n9. Communication Issues\nThis size can make it very difficult to continue that personal rapport with each employee. Communication tends to be impossible as regularly as you would like. That calls for different measures to stay connected with staff, such as using Slack and other collaborative tools. Host video conferences to stay close to remote employees. -Peter Daisyme, Hostt\n10. Defined Roles And Responsibilities\nI've been part of startups with ten people where everyone did a little bit of everything and no one really needed titles or an organizational chart to follow. However, growing to 50 employees, it's time to create a formal structure and designate much more specific roles so everyone knows what they are doing and who they can report to. -Angela Ruth, Calendar\n11. Hiring An HR Manager\nFounders tend to handle hiring, payroll, and other HR tasks for new businesses, and perhaps pass the job off to an office administrator as the business grows. But when you hit 50 or more employees, it's time to hire an HR manager to take care of human resource issues, and particularly federal, state, and local regulatory compliance issues related to staffing. -Justin Blanchard, ServerMania Inc.\n12. Increased Security Risks\nThe more employees you have, the more devices and access points are now involved in your network. Plus, there is greater concern over the likelihood that an employee may not be trustworthy. There is so much more to monitor that you will need to have professional assistance in setting up a system of access controls to ensure greater protection. -Murray Newlands, ChattyPeople\n13. Losing Control\nBefore a company hits the 50-employee mark, you can keep a close eye on almost every facet of the business, and work with a core team of people while knowing almost everyone. After 50, it's easy to feel a loss of control over employees, tasks, and details of the business. Make sure you have a solid management team in place with goals, springs, and productivity tracking. -Marcela De Vivo, Brilliance\n14. Having a Full-Time Lawyer\nHaving a full-time lawyer becomes practical when you have more than 50 employees. Depending on your business, you can now expect enough labor, commercial, environmental, trade and other disputes to make it worthwhile to have someone ready to handle them all year long. Save yourself more time by having a lawyer you can consult whenever you need to, before a big move. - Matt Doyle, Excel Builders",

    "content": "100 Great “Sandler Questions” … and When to Ask Them\nMy message for sales professionals is simple: You’re a consultant, so behave like one. That means asking the right questions… then asking more questions … and even more questions …. until you fully understand what the buyer needs to be able to close the gap between where they are and where they want to be.\nHere is a list of 100 classic “Sandler Questions” – five questions in twenty categories – that can get your creative juices going and among other reasons to take a therapeutic approach to sales calls. The lists below do not follow any specific pattern, nor are the questions intended to be asked in the sequence below. My advice is that you use this list to help you identify your favorite 10-15 questions, and then practice them so you have them ready when you want to take charge of the interview – or for when you hear crickets and see the tumbleweeds rolling.\nIn posing these or any questions to a buyer, remember:\n- Get the tonality right.\n- Nurture, nurture, and then nurture some more.\nBuilding rapport…\n- Thanks for inviting me over today, since we spoke on the phone has anything changed?\n- Do we still have 45 minutes to try to understand whether or not we might be a good fit?\n- Will you be comfortable me asking you lots of questions about (X)? You can ask me anything too, of course, fair?\n- Help me see the world through your eyes: what key things can you tell me about the business?\n- When we get to the end of the meeting if we’re both happy to move on to the next stage, and I have no idea what that might look like yet, let’s agree to scope it out and set a date in both of our calendars – that way we can make sure we stay on target. Fair?\nTo start the ball rolling…\n- So, why have you invited me over today and how are you hoping I might be able to help?\n- Most of our new clients tell us that they’ve never bought this kind of thing before. Would it make sense for me to tell you a little bit our organization and how we do things, then you can tell me about yours? Are you comfortable with that?\n- When we spoke, you mentioned that (X) is an issue for you. How long have you been thinking about, or dealing with it?\n- Most of our time is spent helping businesses like yours. tell me a little bit about how you go about dealing with (X) at the moment?\n- Would it make sense to start by telling me what’s the single thing that gives you most concern about (X) right now?\nNear the beginning…\n- What were you hoping that I could do for you?\n- When did you first decide that you should look into (X)?\n- If you were to pick just one or two key things that you didn’t like about your current solution or provider, what would it be?\n- How would you rate things at the moment, from 1 – DISASTER, to 10 – PERFECT? (Whatever The answer, you say, “OK, why?”)\n- If I didn’t think that I could help you, would you be OK, if I told you so; and will you be OK extending the same courtesy to me if you ever feel that I’m not the right fit for your needs too?\nTo test understanding…\n- I don’t suppose you could give me a good example?\n- Just tell me a little bit more about it.\n- What do others in the department/company/office say about this issue?\n- What surprises you most about this issue?\n- Would it be fair to say that this issue is very difficult to objectively measure?\nNear the middle…\n- Where do you see the biggest need for improvement?\n- I don’t suppose you’ve given much thought to what performance standards will you be using to measure success in this issue?\n- What few things would prevent you from improving your current issue?\n- What thought have you given to implementing a different solution?\n- Let me take a moment to summarize what I think I’ve heard so far, so you can tell me if I’m on the right page. Fair?\nUnderstanding the Pain…\n- How serious would you say the problem is right now, today?\n- What’s the real, real, real problem?\n- Have you ever considered giving up on solving this issue?\n- If the situation didn’t improve, or even got worse, how concerned do you imagine you or the business would be?\n- What do you think this issue has cost the business over, say, the last (month/6 months/two years/whatever)?\nWhen trying to understand the Budget…\n- Typically, when we get to this stage, our clients tell us that they have no money in the budget for this kind of stuff. Am I right in assuming that this is the situation here too?\n- I don’t suppose you’ve given any thought to what it might take in terms of investment to get this fixed for you, right?\n- Think of hotels. Are you imagining a 3-star, 4-star, or 5-star budget to get this fixed? (When they answer, ask:) And that means what in terms of a range of price points?\n- Where do you imagine the money for this kind of investment will come from, and whose money is it?\n- Who controls the budget for this kind of issue? Shouldn’t they be involved in this process already?\nUnderstanding who else should be involved…\n- In my house there are some decisions that are mine, and some that are “ours,” if you get my drift. How would you describe this one for me?\n- When a company such as yours usually buys this kind of stuff, for this kind of money, involving this sort of issue, or these many people, who has the final say?\n- Who authorizes these kinds of decisions around here, and how long does it usually take? Is it like trying to get an octopus into a string bag?\n- I don’t suppose you have any idea who else we should talk to about this before I go away and spend my time and resources in putting a proposal together? I really don’t want to waste anybody’s time, least of all mine.\n- Tell me how to make sure that everyone that needs to see this, or comment, feels that they have had a chance to be heard. What should I do?\nWhen you’re trying to understand the timescales…\n- What time frame are you working towards? (Whatever they say, ask:) Why so soon?\n- Have you seen an increase in these types of issues over the last few months? Help me to understand if things are getting worse, and if so, how quickly?\n- If I said that we couldn’t possibly deliver this before (date), what do you think you’d do?\n- What’s more important; cost or speed?\n- When, in terms of a date, would you like to start to see or feel the benefits of implementing this new solution?\nTo get back on track when the interview is wandering…\n- Tell me again about …\n- What does your boss think about this situation?\n- To be sure we get all your agenda on the table, what’s the next thing that’s concerning you most?\n- Looking at the time we agreed for this meeting, what should we discuss next?\n- I bet you can’t guess what surprised me most about what you said earlier. Can you?\nTo ask near the end…\n- Considering all the things we have discussed so far, what am I missing, what have we left out?\n- So far in our discussion, what one thing has most surprised you?\n- Why, and under what circumstances, would you consider giving us the opportunity to address these issues for you?\n- What would you say if I thought you could be doing things better?\n- Which other suppliers are you also talking to about this at the moment?\nWhen teeing things up for a referral…\n- I’m guessing that you don’t know any other businesses like yours who are experiencing similar sorts of issues?\n- Assuming that things go well, and you give us the order, what would be the best way for me to ask you for a referral at the end of all of this?\n- My business is built on referrals, so I’m almost certainly going to ask you at some point for your help in that regard. If I forget to mention it, will you remind me?\n- What would you need to see from me in order that you would almost certainly refer me to everyone you know?\n- At the end of this process, let’s agree to take a look in our little black books and see if we can figure out a couple of great referrals for each other. Fair?\nFor meetings involving groups…\n- Which of you called or arranged the meeting for us all today? Would it make sense for you to start by sharing what you might like us to address, think about, or discuss most today?\n- What’s the one key issue that the group all believe needs addressing first?\n- Typically, when ‘groups’ are involved in decisions such as this, it’s sometimes difficult to reach a timely consensus. Who’s really in charge or has the casting vote?\n- Is the decision going to be decided by a vote, or, if not, what other method will you use to decide who gets assigned this project?\n- It’s hard to present to a group: who’s really making this decision today? I’ll try to keep taking his/her temperature most. Is that fair?\nWhen presenting your wares/solution/price…\n- Before we continue, can we agree what the next step would be if you like what you see – and by “like,” I meant a solution that addresses all of the main points that we have discussed?\n- How would you feel if I could show you a really perfect fix for this problem today?\n- Before I show you our (X), let’s take a few moments to recap everything that you said so far, fair?\n- I don’t suppose you have imagined what you’d like to see from me today, right?\n- Is what you have seen close to what you had hoped I might show you?\nIf the buyer wants to “think it over”…\n- That’s totally understandable, most of our customers need time to think it through. Could it be that you’re worried about the cost, the implementation programme, or not being too sure about what you’ve heard?”\n- Hmm. If I believed that you were making the wrong decision, how might I tell you without you getting upset?\n- Most of the time I hear, “Let me think about it”, what I’m really hearing is a, “No thanks” – is that what’s happening here?\n- OK, well that makes sense, I think I’d be saying the same to you about now. What should we do next so that I properly understand when and if I should just close the file and move on?\n- Makes sense. Tell me, if I don’t hear back from you by (date), what should I do?\nWhen you feel they are shopping your price/expertise…\n- Are you looking for the cheapest PRICE, or the cheapest COST to get the problem fixed?\n- Are you likely to choose the lowest cost provider in this instance?\n- If you could only have two, would you say you are looking for a ‘good’, ‘fast’, or ‘cheap’ solution?\n- I don’t suppose you could share with me what prices you have had from others so far?\n- If we can’t get to within, say, 15% of your target price, what will you do next? (Whatever answer you get, ask:) What is your target price, and where did it come from?\nWhen the buyer gives you the ‘go-ahead’ (or order)…\n- What do you imagine your bosses might say when you tell them that you have recommended us for the project?\n- How do you feel about giving us the order, are you nervous about it at all?\n- What was the single best thing that swung it for us?\n- What do you imagine your biggest internal barriers to implementation might be?\n- When would be the best time to meet to talk about the next similar issue on your radar?\nWhen you think it’s a “No”…\n- I get it, it’s over; let’s call off the dogs. Just before I go, where did I go wrong?\n- I’m getting the feeling that it’s all over, am I right?\n- Sounds to me that no matter what I said or what our solution could do for you, it still wouldn’t make any difference – am I right?\n- I’m getting the impression that you’re going to either choose another supplier, or do nothing at this time; no hard feelings, such is life – what is the one thing you wanted to see that we couldn’t do for you?\n- Thanks for telling me “no”, I really appreciate the honesty – when would be best for us to talk again?\nWhen making a cold call…\n- Would it be OK to take 30-seconds to tell you why I called, then you can decide whether it makes sense to continue?\n- What have I said so far that sounded interesting?\n- Who, other than you, would it be best for me to talk to?\n- I’m going to give myself a note to call you again in …, is that OK? What should I do if I can’t get hold of you at that time?\n- This is a cold call, shall I hang up first, or you?\nFive strategic questions for senior executives…\n- Let’s pretend that these issues were somehow magically solved right now, today; from your perspective alone, how much better would next 1, 3, and 5 years look?\n- Do you think this is mainly a staff, skills, strategy, structure, or a sales issue?\n- How much would you guess this problem has cost your business in terms of money, profit, time, resources, energy, people, meetings, remedial action, and consultants and so on over the last (three years)?\n- How critical is it to fix this thing? And how would you rate its importance?\n- When you look back five years, did you expect to be ahead of where you are today? If so, how far ahead, and in which ways?\nExcerpted from Asking Questions the Sandler Way. Copyright © 2017, Sandler Systems, Inc. All rights reserved.",

A popular topic before the pandemic, psychological safety has become that much more so due to its relevance to agility, diversity and inclusion, and remote working.

One crucial misconception among business leaders is that psychological safety will be present in any reasonably healthy work environment, like freedom from harassment or a commitment to keeping workers injury-free are.

    "content": "9 Strategies to Create Psychological Safety at Work\nAs a leader, one of your top priorities is to help your team members succeed and feel engaged with their work. But if you don't create psychological safety at work, those ambitions will not be possible.\nIn fact, data from Gallup reveals that just three in 10 U.S. workers strongly agree that their opinions seem to count at work. Further, one study revealed that by moving that ratio to six in 10 employees, organizations would realize a 27% reduction in turnover.\nIn this article, we'll talk about what psychological safety is, why it matters, and strategies for creating it at work.\n- What is psychological safety\n- What does psychological safety matter\n- How to measure psychological safety\n- How to create psychological safety at work\nWhat is psychological safety?\nDr. Amy Edmondson, the Harvard Business School professor who coined the term psychological safety, defines it as, \"a belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns or mistakes.\"\nEdmondson pointed to psychological safety as a critical factor for high-performing teams. More recently, Google's research on characteristics of high-performing teams identified psychological safety as their top indicator of the performance of a team.\nTeams with strong psychological safety are less afraid of the negative consequences that may result from:\n- Taking smart risks\n- Making mistakes\n- Sharing their opinions within their team\n- Being candid with one another\nWhy does psychological safety matter?\nTeams that feel empowered to share their perspectives with each other, especially when their opinions differ from the rest of the group, are able to more fully leverage the knowledge and talent that each member brings to the team. These teams are more likely to take initiative and consider the full picture of each situation. This in turn enables the team to innovate and find effective solutions.\nPsychological safety is also critical to a team's ability to give and receive candid, respectful feedback. If your organization is looking to build a stronger feedback culture, take a look at employee perceptions of psychological safety as a starting point.\nBenefits of psychological safety\nWhen it comes to performance, creating a trusting environment is essential. The Harvard Business Review has shared multiple studies that describe psychological safety as an important factor in high-performing (and hybrid) teams, and the teams who are most effective at problem solving have been shown to share two common traits: cognitive diversity and psychological safety.\nNot only does psychological safety improve your team’s performance, it also enhances employee engagement. When team members feel that their insights are appreciated they:\n- Feel like a respected part of their team\n- See the value of their work\n- Feel accepted for who they are and the unique strengths they bring\nThe relationship between psychological safety and DE&I\nPsychological safety is a key component of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. Diverse opinions, experiences, and knowledge can be better leveraged if team members feel comfortable speaking up and are accustomed to considering alternate viewpoints. Highly inclusive teams are empowered to share their unique perspectives with each other and are better positioned to reap the benefits of having a diverse team.\nHow to measure psychological safety\nOne way to measure psychological safety in your organization is through employee surveys. However, traditional psychological safety assessments tend to focus solely on perceptions at the team level. Consider asking questions that measure employees' perceptions of psychological safety both at work and within their team.\nLeverage a pulse survey template to ask the right questions about whether team members feel that they can share their opinions, take risks, and make mistakes.\nWhen reviewing your results, focus your data analysis at the team-level, rather than within the organization overall. While it's valuable to have an understanding of the level psychological safety throughout your organization, any action that you take to improve psychological safety will be most effective within teams.\nHow to create psychological safety at work\nNow that you know what it is, why it matters, and how to measure it—how do you transform your team environment and create psychological safety at work? Try using these nine strategies to create psychological safety at work.\n1. Promote self-awareness.\nTo create psychological safety in the workplace, start by building self-awareness in your team. When you recognize how you prefer to think and behave, you can uncover biases that might be impacting your employees’ willingness to share their viewpoints.\nSelf-awareness also empowers you to understand your typical responses to changes or challenges. With this knowledge, you can adjust your emotional responses and learn to react in a way that invites open discussion.\nThere are multiple ways to begin building self-awareness, including using 360° reviews and assessments like the Emergenetics Profile to better understand yourself and your team.\n2. Demonstrate concern for team members as people.\nYou may or may not be naturally inclined to ask team members how they are doing. Still, by getting into the practice of checking in with your employees, you demonstrate your concern and interest in them as people. Taking this simple action can help team members feel more comfortable speaking up because they know you appreciate their whole selves – not just their work product.\n3. Actively solicit questions.\nAs your team is arriving at a decision, pause your meeting to ask for questions, different viewpoints and considerations that have not yet been voiced. And, count to ten in your mind before moving on. Often, internal processors may need more time to formulate their thoughts before voicing them, so train yourself to pause and encourage input.\n4. Provide multiple ways for employees to share their thoughts.\nWhile some employees may be comfortable sharing their thoughts in a meeting, others may prefer to have more time to think through their responses. Encourage team members to share feedback via email or through online collaboration tools, like Slack or Microsoft Teams, in addition to in-person discussions.\n5. Show value and appreciation for ideas.\nIf you truly want your employees to openly share their thoughts, you must establish an environment where they feel all ideas are welcome. As you brainstorm, suspend judgement. Remember, you do not need to act on every idea; however, thanking people for their contributions and showing appreciation for their insights will go a long way in establishing psychological safety.\n6. Promote positive dialogue and discussion.\nEncourage team members to use positive language to inspire honest conversations. Cognitive studies have shown that affirmative language can actually motivate you to succeed. Simple word changes like using “have not yet” in place of “can’t” or “opportunity” instead of “challenge” can help your team members employ a positive mindset that empowers them to speak up without fear.\n7. Be precise with information, expectations and commitments.\nTo build psychological safety, your team members need to trust you and your word, so be mindful about the information you share as well as the expectations and commitments you set. Be accurate. Be realistic. And, be thoughtful. Setting clear expectations and adhering to your commitments will help employees trust you and be more open with you.\n8. Explain reasons for change.\nIn the course of business, timelines will shift and your plans will need to adjust. Some of your team members will have an easy time transitioning while others may be thrown. When expectations change or new information is revealed, be clear about what changed and why and give your team members time to process the change.\n9. Own up to mistakes.\nFailure can be frightening, and as a leader, you can take the sting out of it for your employees by owning up to the mistakes you’ve made and celebrating failures as learnings. Regularly ask employees what they’ve done that didn’t work out as expected and what they learned from those experiences. Doing so will help team members recognize that they won’t be punished for mistakes and help them feel more comfortable taking risks and speaking up.\nAs a leader, the tone you set for your team has the power to make or break your employees’ success and engagement. When you employ these nine strategies to build psychological safety, you will empower your employees to share their ideas, learnings and concerns, which will spark your team’s performance.\nRelationships are critical to the success, engagement, and psychological safety of individuals and teams at work.

    "content": "Innovation is a strategic imperative — ultimately, corporate survival depends on it. But executives (and shareholders) are usually pretty underwhelmed with innovation efforts. What is going wrong? We started this series with the hypothesis that culture was the missing piece of the puzzle.\nHow do you create an innovation culture — and make it stick?\nThis is what we learned from the academics, consultants and innovation leaders we spoke to:\nYou can only make innovation culture stick if you embrace its 'dark side' — the boring and more difficult parts\nWho did we talk to?\nGary Pisano, professor of business administration at Harvard Business School.\nWhat did we focus on?\nSome executives see ‘innovation culture’ as faddish or clichéd. It could be down to change fatigue, past innovation promises left unfulfilled, or simply a feeling that technology and disruption have been over-hyped recently. To convince the sceptic, innovation leaders have to show that innovation culture is not just fun ideation sessions, it is about accountability and measurement too.\nIn Pisano’s words\n“People gravitate towards the nice side of culture. The easy side. And in doing so, they overlook the harder, or darker, side of culture.”\nRead Innovation culture has a dark side you need to embrace.\nDon’t see innovation culture as rule-breaking, change the rules\nWho did we talk to?\nTendayi Viki, associate partner at Strategyzer; Catherine Wallwork, head of innovation engagement and mindset at Deloitte Ventures; and Yossi Feinberg, professor of management and professor of economics at Stanford University.\nWhat did we focus on?\nTurning innovation in a heroic endeavour where individuals prevail against all odds is often where programmes start to go wrong. It makes for a great story, but it doesn’t set up an environment where you get repeated success. There are seven main pitfalls companies should avoid, from a lack of clear vision to a lack of CEO involvement; from copying culture to giving innovation teams proper support; from a rallying-cry or CEO-mandate not being enough, to seeing culture as a static concept.\nIn Feinberg’s words\n“People can get distracted by what an innovative culture might look or feel like without first being clear on how innovation will enable their organisation to be successful in a sustainable way.”\nRead Seven myths and missteps of innovation culture.\nYou’ve got to rattle a few cages\nWho did we talk to?\nMatt Atkinson, former C-suite executive at Tesco, Saga and The Co-op Group.\nWhat did we focus on?\nIt can be hard to get a company started on innovation — not everyone will feel there is an imminent threat that they need to respond to. If this is the case, you need to find ways to make that case using an arsenal of “decent insight”. You need to push enough to secure a pot of capital, and apply structure and discipline to dispel sceptics.\nIn Atkinson’s words\n“If you’ve been isolated and done nothing to bring the organisation with you, you’ve got a problem. The old world will kill the new world.”\nRead Culture change – sometimes you’ve got to rattle a few cages.\nIf you want innovation culture to stick, you need to build it into performance reviews and bonus schemes\nWho did we talk to?\nHerminia Ibarra, professor of organisational behaviour at London Business School.\nWhat did we focus on?\nMicrosoft, under Satya Nadella, is among the minority of companies that have successfully managed a true cultural transformation. Ibarra says it comes down to two things — they refocused their performance reviews around innovation and weighted compensation packages around the new products. She talks through five questions that can help determine if a company is ready to take culture change as seriously as Microsoft.\nIn Ibarra’s words\n“Building an innovation culture will not succeed without the leadership of the CEO. Period.”\nRead The questions every corporate innovation leader asks about culture, answered.\nSenior leadership has to put skin in the game\nWho did we talk to?\nBen Allgrove, partner and chief innovation officer at Baker McKenzie.\nWhat did we focus on?\nChanging a dusty sector like law isn’t easy, but law firms have come under intense pressure from both new tech entrants and clients who refuse to pay high legal fees. Baker McKenzie pushed through a digitisation programme over five years and shared how they managed it — from senior staff putting their political capital on the line to recruiting “ambassadors” for the programme across the business.\nIn Allgrove’s words\n“Having someone from the leadership willing to sacrifice 50% of their time adds credibility.”\nRead Under new threat, law firms learn to innovate.\nYour innovation programme will keep changing over time\nWho did we talk to?\nBen Luckett, chief innovation officer at Aviva.\nWhat did we focus on?\nInsurer Aviva started off with a digital transformation programme, but ended up with both a venture building unit and a corporate venture capital fund. Luckett explains how he learned to navigate different time horizons to manage short and long-term tensions, embedding innovation at the heart of corporate strategy — not appended to it.\nIn Luckett’s words\n“I don’t think it’s particularly helpful to set innovation up as any more important than anything else we’re doing for customers on a day-to-day basis. Why should the back-office finance function that keeps the ship moving be given any less prominence or value?”\nRead Six lessons Aviva learned about working with startups.\nStop obsessing about 10x — 10% innovation is important too\nWho did we talk to?\nPascal Brier, group chief innovation officer at Capgemini.\nWhat did we focus on?\nOften innovation is understood as something strategic and transformational, but Brier says many companies can benefit from a more incremental approach. Encouraging all employees to have a 10% improvement mindset every day, in everything they do, can have a powerful impact.\nIn Brier’s words\n“You create a lot of testing, you pretend you’re doing open innovation, you’re endorsing new technologies, but if it never hits your operation, it never changes the way you do things.”\nRead Stop obsessing about 10x — 10% innovation is important too.\nTo keep innovation culture going, you will need 'safe spaces' and coaching\nWho did we talk to?\nStefano Brusoni, professor of technology and innovation management at ETH Zurich; and Ben Bensaou, professor of technology management at INSEAD.\nWhat did we focus on?\nStarting to change is easy. Keeping it going once the initial enthusiasm has faded is harder. Brusoni and Bensaou offer some strategies, from embedding innovation coaches in the business (like Bayer did) to making sure the innovation team has enough diversity to it. It is important to understand the psychological side of innovation — that anxiety affects all of us (even the agitators), the importance of short-term feedback routines, and the value of collaborative innovation.\nIn Bensaou’s words\n“You can’t just go around evangelising and advocating for innovation… you need to create a protected and fully legitimised space where anybody can innovate.”\nRead Seven steps to sustain change.\nBeing the broker between a startup and the core business is crucial — and takes hard work\nWho did we talk to?\nShereen Zarkani, head of Maersk Growth.\nWhat did we focus on?\nMaking innovation something that is central to an organisation rather than peripheral, takes some planning. Maersk’s venture capital arm has recently focused on making sure its investments get embedded in the business. Zarkani’s team keeps a tight grip on setting up pilots and joint projects and will only back away once things are running smoothly.\nIn Zarkani’s words\n“Corporate venture capital can have a bad reputation for over-promising and not delivering.”\nRead Five steps to keep innovation part of your core business.\nScaling an innovation experiment across the whole company requires is hard — you’ll need clear principles and a lot of soft influence\nWho did we talk to?\nAnne Nijs, transformation lead, rare conditions, Roche.\nWhat did we focus on?\nFour years ago Roche started a small-scale experiment in changing how it interacted with patients with rare diseases. This was successful and Roche wanted to roll it across the business more broadly. This took a whole new set of skills, Nijs told Sifted. It is a case of influencing people rather than coercing, allowing people to adapt the system in their own way while still keeping hold of the essential guiding principles.\nIn Nijs’ words\n“You cannot talk endlessly about vision and purpose. You have to connect it with 'the how'.”\nRead How Roche is scaling innovation culture across the multinational.\nA corporate venturing unit should operate at arms length — but not too far.\nWho did we talk to?\nHeriberto Diarte, CEO of SE Ventures\nWhat did we focus on?\nGiving corporate venture capital the breathing room to succeed, without losing connection to the wider organisation is a tough balancing act. Diarte, who set up and leads Schneider Electric’s venture capital arm, says the unit must look mostly outward, but it will tap into Schneider’s internal experts to evaluate startups. The CVC unit needs a variety of internal and external people as staff — and they need to be paid in line with VC packages.\nIn Diarte’s words\n“We rely on Schneider engineers to vet the viability of unproven technology. I need to know if something is feasible, or if it’s against the law of physics.”\nRead ‘On the edge but close enough’: Creating cultural conditions for CVC success.\nAn end to the series, but also not\nThere’s no single solution to creating an innovation culture. But the last twelve weeks have helped us understand the toolkit a bit better: senior level support, structures (including pay packages) that encourage it, aiming for the small wins as well as the moonshots. You may need innovation coaches, you’ll certainly have to make innovation feel like the rule, rather than the exception.\nDoes this chime with your experience? What did we leave out?

    "content": "The mass exodus from the workforce known as the “Great Resignation” has made us all pause and wonder at the root cause of these departures. Especially in the tech industry where resignations rank among the highest with a 4.5% increase in departures compared to 2020.\nWe conducted a recent pulse survey and found that developers rank “opportunities to learn” in the top three reasons they stay with an organization or decide to move on. In addition to having both formal and ad hoc learning opportunities, an organization’s environment and culture play a major role in supporting the learning needs of developers and technologists.\nEnabling continuous learning in a psychologically safe work environment\nIn a previous post, we discussed what psychological safety is and how to evaluate if your organization is psychologically safe. Psychological safety is when an individual feels comfortable sharing their opinions and ideas without fear of judgment. It creates a virtuous cycle of trust and results in an environment that supports continuous learning. Company cultures that embrace openness encourage team members to be vulnerable and share questions, issues, concerns, and ideas. These team interactions spark curiosity and create opportunities for learning.\nContinuous learning is the process of constant skill and knowledge development. The ongoing learning can be on a personal or professional level, and people who seek both information and formal learning opportunities are commonly referred to as “lifelong learners.”\nWhen professional learning and growth are prioritized within an organization, employees aren’t just focused on completing a task or checking a box. Instead, they desire to find the best way to solve challenges or develop something new and innovative. Oftentimes this leads employees on a journey of learning in order to solve something they’ve never encountered before, and they’re willing to step outside of their comfort zone, take a risk, and discuss a new idea or approach with their teammates.\nWhen members of your team feel confident in their work and they aren’t afraid to fail or make a mistake in pursuit of the best solution for the collective organization, this sets the foundation for a psychologically safe space. It should be noted that “failures\" and mistakes can happen along the way, but are not necessary or guaranteed to happen.\nCreating a culture that supports lifelong learning\nBelow we provide five recommended ways to create an environment of continuous learning within a psychologically safe space.\nMake it clear that mistakes will happen, and that’s ok.\nEngineering teams have measures in place to minimize oversights that might cause their software to become vulnerable or unstable. Coding guidelines, unit testing, and code reviews are some of the most common checks and balances—code reviews alone can reduce the number of bugs by ~60%. But since there is a human element to writing code, mistakes are bound to happen, and having empathy for your team is the best way to overcome any bumps in the road.\nSet the expectation that growth, progress, and innovation can’t happen without a few stumbling blocks from time to time. When employees are encouraged to share their flaws and the steps they took for resolution, others can learn, and your organization is less likely to make the same mistake twice. Learning from past mistakes lets an organization evolve. A bonus benefit from openly sharing mistakes: employees can more quickly process and overcome feelings of regret or discouragement that might accompany the error.\nLeadership that acknowledges their own imperfections or shortcomings\nHey, no one is perfect, right? When your leadership team is open and vulnerable, they’re more relatable, build bridges of trust, and inspire others to do their best work.\nEmployees get signals from their managers on the best way to handle projects, tackle challenges, or bring new ideas to the table. If leaders hide who they really are or the mistakes they’ve made, employees will do the same. Leaders who put on a facade and never admit to their shortcomings might cause direct reports to believe they have to be flawless to fulfill their own responsibilities or to obtain a similar management role.\nOn the other hand, when leaders let their vulnerabilities be known, they become more credible. The team likely sees their leader as more grounded and “human,” and they’re instantly more relatable. Direct reports are more likely to come to them for their input, advice, and mentorship when faced with a challenge. Employees are encouraged to perform their best, take chances, and speak up when they need help because they know both their successes and failures are accepted in the open work culture.\nLeadership that models their own curiosity\nWhen team leaders model their own curiosity, it reinforces the value and establishes the expected behaviors within the team. Curiosity results in learning and innovation. When a leader follows an “innovation technique” with their team, the participants can feel more comfortable speaking up and voicing their opinion since there is a known process the group is following. They feel psychologically safe.\nAside from having a set innovation technique, it’s important that there is buy-in, everyone knows where they stand in the process (what phase they’re in), and everyone has a chance to weigh in. This can be done both synchronously in a meeting and asynchronously.\nDisney’s Method is one approach to sparking creative ideas with three stages: the dreamer, the realist, and the critic. This process helps to create a thinking flow that can be used to generate, evaluate, critique ideas, and solve problems. The first step is about sharing ideas and solutions. The second step helps to turn an idea into reality, and the third step is meant to identify weaknesses to help create a flawless plan. By having a formal process for a team to follow, participants can feel more empowered to speak up, collaborate, and learn from each other.\nEncourage employees to follow their curiosity and ask questions\nBeing curious is recognizing the gap of our knowledge about something that interests us and closing that gap through seeking new knowledge and learnings. According to Brené Brown, a research professor at the University of Houston, “choosing to be curious is choosing to be vulnerable because it requires us to surrender to uncertainty. We have to ask questions, admit to not knowing, risk being told that we shouldn’t be asking, and, sometimes, make discoveries that lead to discomfort.”\nCuriosity starts with the sharing of knowledge. Sharing interesting or unique pieces of information with your team can expose others to a new way of thinking. There is a snowball effect that happens when ideas are shared. The more knowledge that is shared, the more interest is built, and the more curious people become.\nHave you ever remained silent in a group because you didn’t want to speak up and admit you didn’t understand the topic being discussed? Curiosity can sometimes lead to discomfort. By creating a safe space that removes the shame that can come with confusion, employees can become passionate about learning more. A simple way to build curiosity and interest is by encouraging your team to ask questions in different settings from small scrum meetings to organization-wide Ask Me Anything events (AMAs).\nOpenly share knowledge and make it visible to the entire organization.\nActor and radio personality Casey Kasem once said, “Success doesn’t happen in a vacuum. You’re only as good as the people you work with and the people you work for.” It’s a great reminder of any organization’s many interdependencies that lead to miraculous outcomes.\nRegardless of the team you sit on or your position on the organizational chart, your work can’t (and shouldn’t) be completed in isolation. So, why create silos of knowledge and keep your learnings from other departments?\nKnowledge silos keep employees from understanding and learning from other departments and individuals. Employees are forced to start over from scratch and productivity is shot. Sometimes this “knowledge hoarding” mentality is baked into the culture because employees fear that they might be valued less if they share their knowledge with others. But there is a far better and more efficient way to work—by breaking down knowledge silos.\nWhen employees have an “aha” moment, why not share it for others to learn too? The same goes for when a teammate is involved in a disaster. Sharing stories of failures helps others learn too.\nWhen a developer solves a massive problem by chasing down hard-to-find source code, they should share it with others so the issue can be solved even faster in the future. An employee from the finance team and an employee from the marketing team might be looking to solve a similar problem, and a SaaS offering with scalable knowledge might be part of the answer. Making invaluable knowledge accessible for everyone within the organization helps to drive down redundant work, and employees are able to spend more time growing, learning, and innovating.\nRevamping your company culture to support continuous learning\nAccording to Gartner, the topmost challenge that software engineering leaders today face today is hiring, developing, and retaining talent. Developing talent and providing opportunities to learn will be critical in 2022 to ensure your talent in high-demand sticks around.\nThe five ways provided above give organizations a starting point for creating a psychologically safe environment that cultivates endless learning. In the next and final post, we discuss what to look for in tools and solutions that support the said recommendations.",

    "content": "A Refresher on SWOT\nSWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. The purpose of a SWOT analysis is to objectively review what your organization is and isn’t doing well to create a synthesized view of the current state of your organization. This article will further help you on how to do a SWOT analysis. But, if you need a refresher, be sure to read our introductory post here!\nExcellent strategic planning begins with a keen understanding of where you are today to build a bright and prosperous future. A key concept to remember is identifying the attribute and its impact, be it positive or negative.\nA SWOT analysis is a great way to identify, organize, and fully determine your current state.\nWe’ll discuss what it is in more detail, how to pull it all together, and then most importantly, explain how to effectively put it to use while you have the momentum to do so.\nHow to Do a SWOT Analysis in 5 Steps\nStep 1: Gather the Data You Need Internally and Externally\nA SWOT analysis, by definition, is designed to look at the internal and external forces that hinder or enable your organization and what market forces you need to seize or mitigate. Need help with your SWOT? Use this SWOT template with examples!\nA complete SWOT analysis requires examining internal and external data to create a holistic assessment of your organization’s current state.\nPro Tip –\nWithout data, a SWOT can be filled with opinions instead of data and facts. You can lean into your team’s opinions, but they shouldn’t be the sole basis for your SWOT. Lean on good data.\nInternal Data Sources\n- Past 3 Years Revenue & Next 3- to 5-Year Forecast – Revenue by customer segment, revenue by product line/service offering.\n- Profitability – Operating costs, EBITDA by line of business or market.\n- Marketing Performance – Web traffic analytics, keyword reports, earned and paid media performance and for a few share-of-voice might be a data point you capture.\n- Sales Performance and Pipelines – Closed business, pipeline forecast, time to close.\n- Staff Insights – Including employee engagement/satisfaction, product or service delivery performance.\n- Customer Insights & Customer Analytics – Log in sessions, time spent using product, average customer value, customer satisfaction/ratings and needs, customer surveys.\nExternal Data Sources\n- Consumer Data – Demographics, media consumption, social media usage, consumer behavior.\n- Labor Markets – Labor forecasts, labor market size, labor growth or reduction.\n- Economic Forecasts – Market sizing, market growth, consumer spending forecasts.\n- Marketing Data – Addressable search traffic, addressable audience sizes, industry CPC or CPA averages.\n- Competitor Data – From industry reports, marketing data available, or review sites.\n- Supply Chain Data – Lead times, availability of a product for manufacturing, shipping routes or times.\n- Local Data – Growth or reduction in metros, population by zip code, demographics by zip code.\n- Real Estate – Forecasted commercial/residential values, market forecasts for rent, affordability indexes.\nGet the Free Guide and Canvas to Create a SWOT Analysis\nStep 2: Assess Your Internal Strengths\nLook within and focus on the experience and resources you have today that you can further develop and lean on for continued success.\nPro Tip –\nYour growth strategy and competitive advantages start here. You need to know what you do well today to determine how it will play into your approach to growth and if the unique strengths you possess are your competitive advantages.\nQuestions to ask to help identify your organization’s strengths?\n- What are your core competencies?\n- What differentiates you from your competitors? What do you do better than your competitors?\n- Why do your customers buy from you?\n- What do you do well in marketing, sales, or operations?\n- Do you have any strengths financially?\n- Do you have strengths in your customer service?\nExample Data Sources and Ideas for Strengths\n- What positive feedback have you received from your customers? Are those strengths?\n- What do your employees say during assessments or surveys about your organization’s strengths?\n- NPS scores can help identify strengths.\n- What does your internal data tell you about your current strengths? How do you perform well in marketing, sales, financial management, position, or operations?\nStep 3: Assess Your Internal Weaknesses\nThis can feel like a vulnerable, critical part of completing your SWOT analysis because it requires a level of self-criticism and honesty that can be daunting – but remember, it can be a rewarding exercise if done with objectivity and clarity. You get the chance to identify what’s not working in your organization and how you might address those issues to better support your vision and mission.\nPro Tip –\nYou’ll need to take a step back and be vulnerable and honest about your weaknesses. If you are honest, you’ll be able to create strategies or initiatives to solve your organization’s biggest weaknesses.\nQuestions to Answer\n- Where do you lack resources?\n- What can you do better?\n- Where are you losing money?\n- In what areas do your competitors have an edge?\nExample Data Sources and Areas to Look for Weaknesses\n- Negative feedback received from customers.\n- Critical feedback from employee assessments or surveys.\n- Draws on your NPS scores.\n- Looking at employee turnover rates and exit interviews.\n- Company workflows and efficiency rates.\n- Operational inefficiencies, dragging profitability, or overhead costs.\nStep 4: Assess Your External Opportunities\nFinding opportunities based in your market takes research, a bit of creativity, and skill. It’s about finding external market opportunities that your organization is well positioned to take advantage of, and sometimes it requires thinking outside of the box.\nOpportunities rely solely on external sources, which requires digging and finding good data sources to review your market. And because it’s based on external data, it can be a more challenging section of your SWOT. But it can be refreshing to complete this section in your SWOT because you get to see the world through the lens of an optimist. You’ll get to examine economic and market trends, environmental concerns, and political/governmental regulations that could propel your organization to your desired future state.\nPro Tip –\nThe world is in a constant state of change. When assessing your market opportunities, look for current data and emerging market trends. A market report from 3 years ago might still be relevant but be critical about your sources. Current data is important.\nQuestions to Answer:\n- What are the needs of your customers currently unmet by your organization? Are you positioned to meet those needs?\n- Are there economic trends you might capitalize on?\n- What are the emerging political and social opportunities that you need to capitalize on?\n- What niches have your competitors missed in the marketplace?\nExample Data Sources to Consider\n- Are there any opportunities within changing consumer habits you can capitalize on?\n- Economic forecasts for your geography or industry.\n- Holes in the market your competitors have missed.\n- Opportunities to change or modify your supply chain for your benefit.\n- Political or governmental forces to benefit from.\n- What political or governmental forces could you benefit from?\n- How could the change in real estate benefit your organization?\n- How can you play the shifting global economy to your advantage?\nStep 5: Assess Your External Threats\nThreats are external factors out of your control that can hurt your organization. A threat is not a weakness; those are internal factors that you can generally solve with intention. A threat must be identified to reduce the risk of harm or mitigate possible damages.\nPro Tip –\nThreats can be mitigated, sometimes. In other cases, it’s just something you need to watch closely and respond to when necessary.\nQuestions to Answer\n- What negative economic trends do you need to mitigate?\n- What are negative political or social trends you need to address?\n- Where are competitors about to bite you?\n- Where are you vulnerable?\n- What other external forces do you need to mitigate?\nExample Data Sources to Consider\n- Disruptions in the global supply chain could threaten your businesses.\n- Threats in your competitive environment from new or emerging competitors.\n- Shifts in your target audiences.\n- Changes in technology threaten your competitive advantages.\n- Shifting economic forecasts that are not in your favor.\n- Increasing costs of living for your employees.\n- Rising real estate prices impacting your organization’s rent.\n- Tight labor markets make it challenging to attract talent.\nHow You Know You Got it Right\nStanding back and addressing your current state requires digging deep, getting a bit uncomfortable, and thinking hard about where your organization currently stands today.\nHere’s the checklist of an awesome SWOT analysis:\n- Does your SWOT contain all the key areas relevant to your plan? This needs to include insights about customers, employees, leadership, competitors, industry trends, and external market forces.\n- Does each item in your SWOT identify the attribute and the impact?\n- Is each item under strengths and weaknesses internal and controllable?\n- Are the items under opportunities and threats external and not controllable?\n- Were you honest about the potential threats and dug deep enough to find the ones you may not want to see?\nYou’ve Done Your SWOT? What’s Next?\nNow that you’ve done the heavy lifting, how do you make sure your hard work isn’t in vain? You use what you’ve got to get what you want, which is a roadmap to success. The most important thing is to use your SWOT to turn the information into goals, actions, and other elements of your strategic plan.\nStrengths – Create Goals & Identify Competitive Advantages\nThe strengths section of a SWOT helps create a few specific outputs. The first of which is to help create goals and actions for your team to build upon your strengths.\nThe second output of your strengths is to help your organization identify its competitive advantages. We’ve covered this extensively in our competitive advantages post and guide, so check that out here!\nExamples of Strengths\n- How do you build upon your strong brand reputation?\n- How can you continue to have high staff retention and build an amazing culture? Could a Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility initiative help create an inclusive culture?\n- If you have great marketing presence, what can you do to improve it even further?\nWeaknesses – Pick Urgent and Important Themes to Address\nThe weaknesses section helps your organization identify clear areas of improvement. The key here is that you need to decide what is most important or urgent to act upon, and then create goals or actions in your plan to address these weaknesses.\nLooking at your weaknesses, it is entirely within your ability to control and change them, so you can create initiatives to solve areas of concern. It is recommended to start with the most pertinent and then work your way through the list from there.\nExamples to Show How to do a SWOT Analysis\n- If you have high turnover and unhappy employees, examine what can be done to change behaviors, outcomes, and improve your culture. Identify key areas of concern and make commitments to shifting that methodology or behavior.\n- Examine work processes and determine how to make things simpler.\n- Invest in employee learning and development to increase their value both intrinsically and to the organization.\n- Examine your physical real estate and determine the need for it in relation to a remote work environment, or you can make changes like reconfiguring, growing, or downsizing your office space.\nOpportunities – Prioritize Your Opportunities, Build a Growth Strategy\nExamine your opportunities and create short-term and long-term goals focusing on how to strategically go after them to win more business or benefits for your organization.\nYour external opportunities paired with your competitive advantages are what feed your growth strategy. Check out our post and guide on building your growth strategy!\nPro Tip –\nHave too many opportunities and not sure what you need to prioritize? Check out our guide on prioritizing opportunities.\nThreats – Watch, and Refresh them Quarterly\nIn most cases, your SWOTs won’t have a significant number of threats, but look at the few you do have as an opportunity to create proactive initiatives.\nIf you don’t need to create proactive initiatives, it is best to review and refresh them quarterly to see if anything is an emerging threat.\nFinal Reminder – If You Create a SWOT, Use It!\nLast tip, whatever you do, do not go through the exercise of putting your SWOT together and then fail to put it to good use. We see that ALL the time. Make sure you use your SWOT to build out your goals and your competitive advantages to set yourself apart and create a winning roadmap for success. Happy strategizing!\nFrequently asked questions\nStill not sure how to conduct a SWOT analysis? Read our Frequently Asked Questions for more clarity.\nOnStrategy recommends five tips to help you easily and thoughtfully develop your own SWOT analysis:\n- Use clear, verifiable, and quantifiable data to form your SWOT- not just opinions.\n- Be clear and write complete sentences, not just singular words. For example, instead of citing ‘recruitment’ as a weakness, instead explain ‘Open positions take three or more months to fill’…\n- Only include entries that lead to action\n- If internal opportunities are also identified, be sure to separate the internal opportunities from the external opportunities. Keep it clear and concise, not convoluted!\n- Engage multiple levels of the organization to create your SWOT, not just your executive team.\nA PESTLE analysis can serve as a great alternative or addition to your SWOT analysis. It looks at the various environmental/external forces your organization may come up against such as political, economic, sociological, technological, legal, and environmental forces that can prove as either threats or opportunities to your business.\nFixing the cta placement",

    "content": "How to Run Better Planning Meetings\nI enjoy planning meetings. I also enjoy large, easy jigsaw puzzles.\nWhen you know the basic shape you’re going for, and you have a bunch of the pieces handy, it can be quite satisfying to get them to all fit together into a nice, coherent picture. With a jigsaw puzzle, it’s very clear that the value is in the activity itself. People who puzzle do so because they enjoy spending their time figuring it out—not because they’re genuinely curious about what the end picture might be.\nLike the picture you see when you finish a jigsaw puzzle, most of the plans you get at the end of a planning meeting aren’t really meant to last.\nThe details of most plans prove incorrect once the work begins. Dwight Eisenhower understood this, leading him to use the quote above about plans being worthless in multiple interviews. But he also understood that the planning process forced teams to dive into the details, explore their options, and consider alternatives. The knowledge gained during this process is what made it possible for them to quickly adapt as the work unfolded.\nThat’s useful, because:\nNo battle plan survives first contact with the enemy.\nHelmuth von Moltke the Elder, Chief of Staff of the Prussian army before World War I\nMoltke is widely recognized as a brilliant military expert and strategist. This rough translation of Moltke’s thesis came from hard lessons learned. As warfare in the 1880s rapidly evolved in response to inventions such as the machine gun, he found it was no longer possible to sit back and plan out a full battle. He could plan the opening moves, and after that, he’d need a “system of expedients”—meaning good alternatives—that his commanders could choose from as the battle progressed.\nOne hundred and thirty years later, Steve Blank, a guru of Lean startups and entrepreneurship, rephrased Moltke’s quote like so:\nNo (business) plan survives first contact with customers.\nSteve Blank\nSo – plans are worthless, and this month we’re kicking off a new program for team leaders where we help them develop a plan for their meetings. After 3 focused sessions, they’ll leave with a plan they can bring to their team laying out:\n- Which meetings they should run and how to run them\n- How often they should meet\n- How they’ll manage all the ways God likes to laugh at plans like this\nIf all the quotable gents above are correct and plans are useless, how can this be a good idea?\nThis is a wonderfully useful program because planning is everything.\nThe value of planning comes from the conversations you have with your team. In a great planning meeting, you’ll build enthusiasm, create alignment, and make decisions that enable action. Without the planning discussion, coordinated action is not possible.\nTeam leaders who complete our program will take their draft plan back to their team. They’ll share what they learned, what they suggest, and the challenges they see. Then, the whole team will run a planning meeting to decide on exactly what they’ll do. As they learn what works, they’ll regularly update their plan going forward.\nStatic plans are worthless. Living plans are everything.\nMy version!\nToday I want to dig into why this is a super-smart approach to useful planning, regardless of the type of plan you’re making.\nContents\nLet’s start with definitions. When I say “Planning Meeting,” this is what I mean.\nDefinition: What is a Planning Meeting?\n- A Plan:\n- A proposed series of actions for achieving something.\n- A Planning Meeting:\n- A meeting that teams use to create a plan and secure commitment to taking the first steps.\nThe purpose of a planning meeting is to create plans AND secure the group’s commitment to implementing the plans.\nDuring a planning meeting, the team seeks to answer these questions:\n- Given our strategy, goals, and what we know now, what’s our plan?\n- Who will be responsible for what by when?\nWhen the planning meeting ends, teams should have these results.\nWork Outcomes\n- A documented rough plan that can be quickly formalized after the meeting.\n- Clarity about who will do what by when.\n- Visibility into dependencies, missing resources, and known problems to solve.\n- Awareness of the known unknowns; those areas in need of further investigation.\nHuman Outcomes\n- Understanding of the plan’s scope.\n- Clarity about how one’s work will be coordinated with others.\n- New knowledge about the possible ways to approach this work.\nExamples\n- Quarterly Planning (Rocks or OKRs, anyone?)\n- Project Planning\n- Campaign Planning (Marketing)\n- Product Roadmap Planning\n- Sprint Planning\n- Event Planning\n- Work Planning…\nYou get the idea. 🙂\nWhat about Strategic Planning? Not so much. When done well, strategic planning is a process composed of many activities, including several meetings. Only a few of these are really about making plans – and there’s a good case to be made for keeping your strategy and your planning meetings separate.\nHow to Spot a Worthless Waste of Time (WWoT):\nCommon Approaches That Yield Terrible Plans\nThe most common mistakes occur when a leader schedules a “planning meeting,” but actually runs a different type of meeting instead. Despite what this recent McKinsey article might lead you to believe, there are more than three types of team communication, and knowing the differences between them matters.\nWWoT 1: The Fait Accompli\nThe Plan is Done. Now you dummies get to work!\nWhat this looks like:\nThe Plan Master walks into the meeting with a PPT deck and presents the plan. They tell people their tasks, deadlines, tracking systems, and how it will all come together beautifully because they’ve outlined the critical path dependencies in purple. They leave the last 5 minutes for questions.\nWhy this Fails:\nThis isn’t a planning meeting. This is a broadcast.\nBroadcasts are a form of information sharing. The Plan Master just delivered a boring webinar to a hostage audience. Maybe if everyone gets a few extra minutes for questions, you could consider this a training on how to understand the plan – but there’s certainly no room here for a meaningful planning discussion.\nNote: There are times when a plan is done and you do need to tell people about it. This happens a lot during All-Hands meetings. That’s fine – just don’t call that a planning meeting.\nWWoT 2: Blue Skying\nHey guys… what if we planned some stuff?\nWhat this Looks like:\nThe Plan Master has a big, beautiful, fuzzy idea. A dream of what might be. Pontificus Maximus brings the team together for an hour, draws some boxes connected to other boxes via arrows, then asks: How can we make this happen? What’s your plan?\nWhy this Fails:\nThis isn’t a planning meeting. This is, at best, an idea generation meeting.\nIn these meetings, it takes the team some time to understand what those boxes might be. The concept is new, which makes it feel hypothetical. So, if there’s even time to talk about how that vision might become a reality, the team will throw out ideas about things they might hypothetically do.\nThe leader may walk out thinking they have a plan. They do not.\nReally, those plans are more like this:\nHypothetically, I could spend 10 minutes every day learning to master pullups. That’s totally feasible. It could happen, and if it did, I’d be happy. I’d like to be able to do a great pull-up. But just because I like the idea and can envision a way to accomplish it, that does not mean I have committed to this plan. I have not.\nWWoT 3: The Shotgun Wedding\nHere’s a new idea. Now you’re committed!\nWhat this Looks like:\nThe Plan Master has a clear idea and a plan for getting it done. They bring the team together and share their idea. Then, like in a real planning meeting, they ask the team for their input. But instead of listening, they nod, reframe or refute every suggestion, and because they want to “respect everyone’s time,” they cut the meeting short by telling everyone exactly what they’re going to do.\nWhy this Fails:\nThis approach is disrespectful, insincere, and dehumanizing. Want to destroy team morale and employee engagement? Ask your team for their ideas, then ignore them. The Plan Master may be surprised when nothing happens, or when their efforts are subtly sabotaged, but no one else will be.\nWant your team to contribute their unique expertise to your plans and enthusiastically commit to carrying them out?\nThen try this instead.\nThe Underlying Structure of an Effective Planning Meeting (and Top Tips!)\nEvery effective planning meeting will include these steps.\nThe Five Steps in an Effective Planning Meeting\n- Greet your group and confirm the meeting’s purpose.\n- Review the proposed plan.\n- Refine the scope and quality of the plan.\n- Fill in the details.\n- Confirm the next steps and the communication plan.\nDepending on the kind of plan you’re creating, it could take 30 minutes to run through these steps – or a full day! You’ll also change how you describe and lead each step to fit the situation.\nTip: To see step-by-step instructions for several different kinds of planning meetings, check out our downloadable meeting templates.\nThat said, here are some tips for each step that apply in most situations.\nStep 1. Greet your group and confirm the meeting’s purpose.\nThis is pretty easy. Of all the meeting types, planning meetings may be the most straightforward. The purpose and desired outcome are fairly obvious to everyone involved, people usually understand how to prepare, and if you keep the meeting running on schedule, you’ll rarely hear complaints about wasting anyone’s time.\nHow do you keep planning meetings on schedule?\nKey to Your Success: Only invite relevant people.\nWho will be responsible for what by when? Anyone who isn’t directly involved in creating the plan will introduce tangents, multitask, slow the group down, and drain their energy. Keep the invite list as small as possible to prevent these problems. When you’re working on a large multi-part plan, this means you should break the meeting up so that participants only need to attend during the times when you’re discussing the bits that apply to them.\nThis makes it possible for you to say:\n“We’re here today to create a plan for <achieving your amazing goal>. You are here because you are the exact right people to make sure we end up with a high-quality plan. This is exciting, because when our plan succeeds, we will <reap all kinds of awesome benefits>. You are key to making that happen.”\nWant to draft your own compelling greeting? Use Leadership Strategies’ IEEI formula!\nStep 2. Review the proposed plan.\nIf possible, share a draft plan with the group in advance. If that wasn’t possible, consider scheduling 5 to 20 minutes for everyone to read the plan silently during the meeting. This eliminates the “blank slate” problem, giving everyone something to build on.\nOnce everyone’s read the draft plan, invite them to ask Clarifying Questions about anything that isn’t clear.\nKey to Your Success: Show up with the plan half done.\nPlanning meetings are for solidifying plans and filling in gaps, not for making up ideas about what you might do out of thin air. (See WWoT2: Blue Skying)\nIf you don’t know enough about the task ahead to get the plan half-formed before the meeting, then you aren’t ready for a planning meeting.\nWant to see what sharing a half-plan looks like in practice? Pay attention the next time you see an action movie. Nearly every action movie includes at least one planning meeting where the ace team discusses their cunning plan. The team leader starts by outlining the scenario, the goal, the available resources, and the bones of a plan.\n“We need to get the treasure out of the fortress before nightfall,” she says. “We have a key to the front gate and a contact inside who can open the vault once we’re in. There’s a private jet waiting for us at the airport.\nNow we just need to figure out how to get past the security…”\nNotice: the goal is clear and they’re starting with a partial plan. Now, the rest of the crew can make the plan brilliant by sharing their expertise.\n“I can take half a dozen men around the back wall to create a diversion,” the commando grunts.\n“I’ll take out their communication system from here, so they can’t call for backup,” the tech geek chimes in.\n“That still leaves the zombies!” the leader says, shaking her head. “How are we going to get around them?”\n“Leave the zombies to me,” says the star.\nAnd there you have a plan!\nPlanning meetings in action movies clearly illustrate these tips: elite squads never invite extra people to the planning meeting; and they always start the meeting with a clear objective, clear boundaries, and a rough plan in mind.\nOf course, the plans in action movies never quite work. Perhaps they should have paid more attention to the next step!\nStep 3. Refine the scope and quality of the plan.\nOnce everyone understands the plan, you can dramatically improve the plan’s quality if you take some time to challenge the plan’s scope and the group’s assumptions.\nFor most planning meetings, this means asking the group to discuss one or two questions like those in the examples below.\nDiscussion Questions for Improving a Plan\nTo challenge the plan’s scope, you might ask:\n- When we complete this plan, what will we be celebrating? If we really care about celebrating that, is there an alternate way to get there?\n- How might we achieve our goal (faster, more easily, with less expense)?\n- Of all the things we need to complete, which parts might end up not being needed? Can we defer those until later?\nSometimes a group will make a plan that’s too conservative because they assume their plan has to work within the safe boundaries they’ve been limited to in the past. Questions like these can uncover ways to simplify the plan by challenging those assumptions.\n- If we had double our current resources, what would we do? Can we do any of those things now?\n- If we could secure one new resource that would greatly increase our chances of success, what would that be?\n- If we could remove all the red-tape, bureaucracy, and annoying parts of this plan that aren’t directly contributing to our goal, what would that look like? Which of these annoyances are within our control? (Kaizen it!)\n- If you had just been hired from outside the company – so you knew nothing about our situation – and your job was dependent on the success of this plan, what would you do differently?\nWhile some groups limit their thinking too much, others are too confident. This makes tools like the pre-mortem one of the most powerful additions to your planning meeting. Reduce the risks associated with wishful thinking and overconfidence by asking these questions:\n- When we’ve tried plans like this in the past, where did we run into problems?\n- Let’s imagine we’re months in the future and this has gone so badly that we’re all out of a job. What happened?\n- Given these possible ways we might fail, what can we change in our plan now to minimize those risks?\nQuestions like these can reveal all kinds of ways to improve your plan, so if it’s really important, it’s worth spending more time here.\nThat said, no plan survives contact with reality, and no amount of conversation will yield a perfect plan. I recommend setting a timer so this discussion doesn’t totally derail your meeting.\nStep 4. Fill in the details.\nTime for the horse-trading, getting down to brass tacks, and shuffling the cards in the deck. Or – prioritizing, resourcing, and scheduling.\nNow, finally, it’s time to put the picture together. Exactly who will do what by when?\nSomeone needs to act on this plan, which probably means taking resources away from wherever they are now. Do you need to negotiate priorities, budget, or access to the team? Brush up on your negotiation skills!\nIf your team gets stuck, this is a great time to break out a prioritization matrix. Plot all the tasks on your plan in the matrix, and use it to agree on the handful of tasks you will start right away. Then, you can regroup to decide on the next set of tasks. (Agile iterations, anyone?)\nPopular prioritizing criteria include:\n- Effort vs Impact\n- Feasibility vs Desirability\n- Cost vs Value\n- Risk vs Value\n- Urgency vs Importance\nAt the end of this step, you’ll have a plan.\nIt doesn’t have to be pretty – someone can clean it up after the meeting. Don’t waste time on the editorial stuff. It’s time to move on to your final step.\nStep 5. Confirm the next steps and the communication plan.\nAre you an elite team of action heroes? Then you know to always confirm the rendezvous point and synchronize your watches.\nFor the rest of us, here’s a reminder.\nI’m surprised by how many planning meetings end without anyone clarifying where this brilliant new plan can be found after the meeting. I’m surprised mostly because this is something I personally forget in the meetings I lead! As the person in charge, I already have an idea of where I’ll post the plan we just worked on, so I forget that not everyone in the room can read my mind.\nLike most businesses, we have all kinds of communication tools and all kinds of ways to document our work. This makes it vital to explicitly state where each plan will be recorded, how we’ll share progress, and how we’ll keep it updated going forward (following our Action Reviews and Plan Refinement Meetings).\nReminder – Static Plans are Worthless, But Planning is Everything!\nMaybe the 2022 version of the quote should be:\nNo return-to-the-office plan survives the next government mandate.\nAnd really, we shouldn’t be too surprised.\nPlans that involve more than five people working together over more than a few days require some midstream adjustment at best, and more commonly, regular and thorough rejiggering.\nWhen we go into planning meetings, we often think that the plan is the point. I mean – OK – that’s what we’re creating and it’s the name of meeting itself, so obviously making a plan is part of the point. Yet, like so many others who have gone before us have discovered, the deeper value comes from all the learning your team does as they work on that plan. The plan itself may well end up proving worthless, but the learning is indispensable. Keep this in mind for your next planning meeting, and watch for opportunities to enhance that learning.\nSpeaking of which, registration is now open for team leaders who want to learn how to free their teams from unproductive meetings. Join us to create a great draft plan that your team will love to help you refine.",

    "content": "Career\nPsychological Safety Is Not a Hygiene Factor\nIt's a key to success in times of transformation.\nPosted September 7, 2021 Reviewed by Tyler Woods\nKey points\n- Psychological safety should not be considered a baseline health and safety factor.\n- A psychologically safe company culture is more challenging to build than most people realize.\n- It is a powerful lever to increase performance and achieve excellence.\nCo-authored with Per Hugander. Per is a strategic advisor helping executives achieve their goals by leveraging science and research in practice.\n“Companies should mandate hygiene factors like ethics and psychological safety.”\nThe comment—made by a participant in an executive program a few minutes into the first discussion of a brand new Harvard Business School case study, Leading Culture Change at SEB—caught us both by surprise. We had worked together on the case, which tracked a successful attempt to influence culture at the fifteen-thousand employee Nordic bank, directly aimed at building psychological safety and perspective-taking so as to enable candid, rigorous conversations about strategic priorities. We each had the same thought at that moment: Psychological safety is not a hygiene factor—defined as something that must be present for a work environment to qualify as adequate, such as a paycheck, benefits, employee physical safety, freedom from harassment, and so forth. Elucidated by Frederick Herzberg, building on Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, hygiene factors don’t create competitive advantage for a company. They merely satisfy basic expectations that free people up to focus on doing a good job. Creating psychological safety, in contrast, constitutes a high standard, an ambition that allows an organization to be truly excellent and capable of transformation.\nBeyond the Basics\nThis is an important distinction, because psychological safety has the potential to offer a competitive advantage for most organizations, it is not table stakes for being in business. In a recent article, “4 steps to boost Psychological Safety at your workplace,” we outlined an approach to developing the skills to create this advantage. Here we build on that work to explore how executives can arrive at the beginning of a transformational journey. To help, we introduce a hypothetical scale for conceptualizing different levels of psychological safety in an organization.\nThe scale ranges from 1-10, where a “2” or below represents a toxic environment with greater problems than the mere loss of employee voice, possibly including backstabbing, excessive self-protection that precludes focused, excellent work, and a guarded, suspicious approach to colleagues and managers. If that does not describe your workplace, that is certainly good news, but it’s not the end of the story.\nA company that falls between 3 and 6 on our scale presents a work environment that appears reasonably healthy, but in fact is less engaged, open, and learning-oriented than first meets the eye. Here, unbeknownst to many managers, countless good ideas are withheld, the information or help needed to do a job well is not sought, and teamwork and collaboration suffer, all without being visibly problematic or toxic. This is the quiet middle zone where the illusion of a healthy work environment persists.\nThe risk of this middle zone is that managers believe their culture is conducive to innovation or agility, when in reality it is more cautious and self-protective than they think. A handful of prominent case studies serve to illustrate this risk, notably, in recent years: Wells Fargo, VW, and Boeing. In these companies, ambitious business goals were not backed up with the open, candid work environment that would have been needed to achieve them. What happened instead was senior executives lived under the illusion that all was well, when in fact bad news was simply being withheld. The culture invisibly all but guaranteed strategic failure in each case.\nFinally, the top of scale, say 7 and above, represents a significant culture achievement. Here is where people can–and do—engage in the hard, interpersonally risky, work of offering criticism, asking for help, sharing out-of-the-box ideas, engaging in dialogue, and other behaviors that promote good decisionmaking, learning, innovation, and ultimately excellence in a changing world.\nRecognizing and Overcoming An Interpersonally Risk-Averse Culture\n“We don’t have a problem with psychological safety” is a phrase we have both encountered in organizations we’ve studied or worked with several times. Of course, it may be true. But more often than not, even though the organization lacks a toxic environment, people may still shy away from the interpersonal risks necessary to making progress on the transformative strategies the market environment demands. For organizations operating in a predictable environment (as was the case in many industries before the COVID-19 pandemic, or before digitalization transformed so many business models) a medium level of psychological safety might have been good enough to maintain a solid position. However, if a demanding, fast-changing environment calls for agility, innovation, or transformation to succeed, this will not be adequate. The necessary level of candor and vulnerability are missing.\nWhen leaders choose to build the level of psychological safety conducive to genuine risk-taking and learning, they improve their chances of success. Despite such organizational cultures being relatively rare, we do not mean to imply that creating them requires heroics or miracles. Both of us have studied and helped with such transformations. For example, in our case study of SEB, one executive reported, “The results came quicker than we expected, and they came in the shape of quicker decisions, better decisions. You slow down to speed up. Strategic problems that had been around for a while, we were able to solve them relatively quickly. Internally and with external stakeholders.”\nThe goal of the intervention at SEB was to strengthen psychological safety and dialogue skills to improve performance in the organization’s fast-changing, demanding market environment. Focused training, as we previously outlined, appears to create strategic progress both for incumbents aiming to adjust to a new environment and for startups that need to transform as they grow rapidly. But crucial to doing this work is recognizing the particular challenges of measuring psychological safety. Research shows that those further up the hierarchy tend to experience higher psychological safety than those lower, despite depending on them for input, ideas, and challenging questions. We believe that the conceptual scale we present in this article can help by making the risky middle zone salient.\nInvite Others to Shape the Journey\nWe have worked with hundreds of executives who have tackled the challenge of altering how they think and interact with peers and subordinates so as to improve business performance. By making a few simple (not easy) tweaks to their leadership behavior, especially in how they set the stage, invite others’ voices, and respond to bad news or challenges, the executives’ conversations slowly transform to become more authentic, courageous, and productive. It becomes clear that psychological safety is neither a hygiene factor nor (our other pet peeve) the “soft stuff” to push aside in favor of hard-nosed business concerns. But getting to this point starts with recognizing the risks lurking in ostensibly healthy workplaces in which holding back sensitive information is the invisible norm.\nWe have found that discussing our scale so as to explain its three basic zones helps build motivation to take the following steps to move further to the right, from anywhere on the spectrum.\n- Articulate the compelling performance goals the team or organization seeks to achieve.\n- Explain why achieving these goals requires people to voice ideas, challenge each other, and be open about problems and failures along the way.\n- Ask your team members for ideas about how to hold yourselves accountable for moving to the right on the psychological safety scale.\n- Agree on a schedule for checking in to assess progress on the business and culture goals as a means for making changes in what will necessarily be an iterative journey.\nThis approach prioritizes a team or an organization’s performance goals as a way of opening up discussions of culture, rather than the other way around. It also helps people understand that the absence of toxicity is not evidence of cultural health and helps executives to see psychological safety as a key to success in a transforming industry while also appreciating the challenge that lies ahead if they choose to hold themselves accountable for building it.",

    "content": "Big launches and milestone achievements deserve to be celebrated. When organizations take time to recognize the hard work that went into the completion of a release or even a bite-sized milestone, this helps employees recharge and stay motivated. The celebration might entail a release party, ending work a few hours early on a Friday, or a handwritten thank-you note.\nBut what happens when a team fails? The deadline for a big release is missed. A bug causes a security vulnerability. Or a change to the production environment causes product downtime.\nAre these failures discussed? Do employees feel comfortable talking about what went wrong with their manager and team? Does your team take the time to reflect upon these situations through sprint retros or post-incident reviews? Does your team explore ways to overcome these mistakes in the future with a different path forwards or approach?\nIf the answer is no to the questions listed above, this could be a sign that teammates or employees across the organization lack psychological safety.\nWhat is psychological safety?\nA psychologically safe work environment encourages team members to speak up with ideas, concerns, or recent failures instead of choosing to remain silent.\nAccording to Amy Edmondson, “psychological safety in the workplace is the belief that the environment is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. It is a belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes.”\nWhen employees feel psychologically safe, they’re willing to take more risks, share ideas, and speak their truth. There is an unspoken agreement that employees will not feel punished or embarrassed when speaking up, whether it’s exposing one’s ignorance by asking questions or offering a new solution or idea to a problem. Trust is created through interpersonal connections and reinforced through an open and transparent environment.\nThis engagement leads to uncharted collaboration, growth, and excellence. In fact, the 2017 Gartner Culture Workforce Survey found that when employees work in a psychologically safe environment, the discretionary effort can improve up to 24%. Discretionary effort means employees put in extra effort above and beyond what is expected because they want to.\nPsychological safety and high-performing teams\nCompany retreats with trust falls and ice breakers can seem nonsensical, but at the core of these activities, there is a desire to create a space in which employees can be vulnerable—a judgment-free zone.\nBy having a psychologically safe environment, employees perceive risk as a good thing, and there is an understanding that employees won’t be seen as ignorant, incompetent, or invalid. Risk in this context could mean challenging the status quo, pitching a novel idea, etc.\nTeams thrive when they take risks and fail (or succeed!) fast. Instead of being stagnant, the momentum continues forward as employees learn from their mistakes. Risk-taking and learning from mistakes so the team doesn’t repeat them again are behaviors of high-performing teams.\nEvaluating your organization’s psychological safety\nBelow are a few ways to gauge the level of psychological safety within your team or organization:\nThere is a tolerance for mistakes\nEmployees are open about the mistakes they made instead of avoiding them or, worse yet, covering mistakes up. When team members make mistakes there is a level of acceptance and it’s not held against them. Leaders treat mistakes as an opportunity to learn and often communicate their own fallibility.\nMicro-moments of learning occur regularly\nLeaders model curiosity by sharing their ignorance on a topic and asking questions. Employees are empowered to ask questions, poke at proposals, and when the answer is unclear, employees are encouraged to level up through on-the-job learnings.\nSpace is created for reflection and review\nThe team takes time to learn from past performances to help with future improvements. Retrospectives allow teammates to discuss what went well and what didn’t go so well. It's an opportunity to brainstorm ways to make future improvements. The 4Ls approach helps to structure team or one-on-one conversations and uncover what was liked, learned, lacked, or longed for after a particular project or after a certain timeframe such as a year or quarter.\nRisk-taking is encouraged\nEmployees voice radical business and technical ideas. They’re willing to take interpersonal risks by speaking up in meetings, voicing their concerns, and never settling without asking “why.” These risks lead to deep levels of participation and ownership.\nThere is a diversity of thought\nMore and more organizations will continue to focus resources on diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) efforts, and Gartner's research found a 1.8x increase in HR executives listing DEI as a top initiative from 2019 to 2020. Companies benefit from cognitive diversity as a result of varying levels of experience, background, gender, and age across the team. There is no “strict power structure” mentality for ideas or initiatives from the leadership team and leadership team only. Employees, regardless of their role, seniority, or tenure, have an equally valid opinion.\nCreating a workplace environment that promotes psychological safety is an art, and there is no silver bullet. There are unspoken agreements, company-wide values, leadership qualities, and technology to help support this ongoing work.\nThis is part one of a three-part series on psychological safety. Next, we discuss how to build a psychologically safe environment through continuous learning opportunities.",

    "content": "What is a SWOT Analysis?\nA SWOT analysis examines your organization’s core Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats in your competitive environment to help develop focus areas in strategic planning. Conducting a SWOT analysis creates a synthesized view of your organization’s current state.\nSWOT assessments help organizations understand their current state, help determine where to go next, and inform the strategic actions to achieve their desired future.\nA good SWOT synthesizes and organizes data (objective) and expert insights (subjective) that summarize the current state. However, like any planning tool, a SWOT is only as good as the information it contains—it is crucial to engage multiple levels of the organization beyond the leadership team to understand the current state and source ideas for opportunities that help develop the future state.\nThe Structure of a SWOT Analysis\nA SWOT analysis is traditionally set up in a grid format. Here’s what it looks like in practice:\nStrengths – Internal\nStrengths refer to the core strengths your organization possesses today. These strengths represent what your company currently does well and should consider building upon for a stronger future.\nPro Tip:\nStrengths are internal, meaning internal strengths coming from within your organization. What does your organization do well that you should capitalize on?\nGet the Free Guide and Canvas to Create a SWOT Analysis\nWeaknesses – Internal\nWeaknesses are internal weaknesses that limit or interfere with your organization’s ability to achieve its desired future state. These weaknesses are things your organization doesn’t do well or needs to improve upon.\nPro Tip:\nWeaknesses are also internal, meaning they are weaknesses that you need to shore up in your organization. What do you need to do better?\nOpportunities – External\nOpportunities are external factors that your organization is well positioned to act and benefit upon. Opportunities are realized if your organization decides to act upon them. These are often drivers of your growth strategies.\nPro Tip:\nThreats often represent your vulnerabilities, which are sometimes out of your control. But what can you mitigate?\nA Great SWOT Analysis Helps Answer These 3 Critical Questions\nCompleting a SWOT Analysis is essential for completing your current state assessment before your organization starts planning. Notably, a good SWOT will help our team answer three critical questions to help inform your growth strategy and where your organization needs to focus during planning.\nGreat SWOTs help answer the following questions:\nHow to succeed, and why?\nA SWOT helps you understand what you’re good at and what you need to work on. Identifying your strengths and weaknesses, paired with market opportunities, creates the foundation for what your organization needs to work on or capitalize on to see success.\nWhat growth opportunities exist, and why?\nAs we mentioned, completing your SWOT analysis helps outline essential growth opportunities. You can follow this beneficial exercise to use your SWOT to identify and prioritize your growth opportunities.\nHow to serve your customers better, and why?\nOne of the outputs of your SWOT is identifying ways you can serve your customers better. Be it growing a strength, assessing one of your customer-facing weaknesses, or seizing a new opportunity, think about how you can best serve your customers.\nPro Tip:\nNeed help setting up your SWOT? Use this SWOT template with examples.\nInternal vs External Forces\nInternal – Strengths & Weaknesses\nStrengths and weaknesses reflect internal dynamics that the organization can control. Therefore, when identifying strengths and weaknesses, it is equally important to consider internal factors that assist your organization in meeting customer needs (such as customer service) as it considers current markets’ and customers’ needs within your control.\nAs a rule, strengths are significant when they assist the organization in meeting customer needs. Conversely, weaknesses that deserve to be in your SWOT include those that might not be clear to your customers but negatively impact the experience customers have.\nExternal – Opportunities & Threats\nOpportunities and threats are external to the organization—things that can be influenced but not completely controlled. These two areas capture both present and anticipated conditions that will affect the organization.\nOpportunities are conditions in the organization’s favor that, if acted upon, could produce rewards. Think of current and new opportunities: what current markets could be penetrated more deeply, and what new markets could be waded into?\nThreats are barriers that may prevent the organization from reaching the desired rewards. Consider threats in terms of social, technical, economic, and political factors and threats from competitors.\n6 Tips for Building an Effective SWOT\n#1 – Use data wherever possible instead of relying only on opinions.\nConsider listing the current data gathered, delegating responsibility for gathering additional data, and populating the SWOT with “what the data tells you.”\n#2 – Write more than 1-2 words for each.\nUse adjectives and descriptive nouns so that the planning team understands the context, e.g., instead of “recruiting” as a weakness, write as, “Time to fill vacant positions is 3 months.”\n#3 – SWOT entries should lead to action.\nIf the energy is taken to add something to the SWOT, consider the “so, what?” Is it something that can be leveraged and acted on, or would it make a difference? If not, there is no need to include it in your SWOT.\n#4 – Identifying internal opportunities in the “Opportunities” section makes the assessment fall apart.\nIf internal opportunities MUST be identified (such as developing career paths for employees, procuring new software, etc.), sort the opportunities into two buckets: internal and external.\n#5 – Engage multiple levels of the organization in brainstorming to source great ideas.\nBuild the SWOT with input beyond the executive team. Engaging managers and front-line staff in the process is critical to a comprehensive assessment of the current state.\nWhat are the Alternatives to a SWOT Analysis?\nThere are several alternatives to conducting a SWOT analysis. However, each is designed to help create a complete analysis of your current state, including examining internal and external forces to help your organization identify growth opportunities and areas to improve upon. The alternatives include:\n- TOWS Analysis – This is the same acronym as SWOT, but backward. Instead of starting with internal strengths, you begin with external threats.\n- PESTEL (or PESTLE) stands for Political, Economic, Sociological, Technological, Legal, and Environmental forces. This analysis is a deeper dive into the external analysis portion of a SWOT, looking at the different external forces that might impact an organization. You can read more on PESTEL here.\nExample SWOT\n| STRENGTHS | OPPORTUNITIES |\n|---|---|\n- We have a dedicated, highly qualified team of teachers and administrators with very little turnover.\n- We have a focus on community, and it is within our ethos as an organization.\n- We are very efficient if we set guidelines and provide clarity to our staff.\n- We don’t have overhead waste. 90% of our funding goes directly to kids and teachers in the classroom.\n- We communicate with our parents and students like no other district – we are the example when it comes to community communication.\n- We have some of the newest schools in the district, creating a collaborative learning environment with some of the latest technology.\n|\n- A new website would make communicating with our parents easier and faster.\n- There is a huge opportunity to redefine and set the standard for community engagement for school districts in our area.\n- Setting a clear direction will allow us to work together in a unified direction.\n- New mediums present – like social media, podcasts, or YouTube – present new ways to reach students and parents.\n- Population growth and new construction in our district is driving enrollment growth.\n|\n| WEAKNESSES | THREATS |\n- We are over-processed and spend too much time in meetings.\n- We do not collaborate well between departments.\n- We operate in silos, and that can create barriers to collaborating.\n- We have very dated back-end technology, including our email systems and curriculum management.\n- We only have one means of communication to parents – a weekly newsletter and call.\n|\n- COVID-19 has pushed many students into permanent virtual learning.\n- The political environment is putting pressure on our board and Superintendent during public meetings.\n- Other areas of the city are growing as well, and that threatens our enrollment levels due to school choice.\n- Loss of funding at the state level.\n|\nSWOT FAQs\nA: Strengths refer to the core competencies your organization possesses today. They represent what your organization does well and needs to build upon to create a better future.\nA: Weaknesses are internal weaknesses that limit or interfere with your organization’s ability to achieve its desired future state. These weaknesses are things your organization doesn’t do well or needs to improve upon.\nA: Opportunities are external factors that your organization is well positioned to act and benefit upon. Opportunities can be realized if your organization decides to act upon them. It’s important to remember that opportunities are external forces, not opportunities within. They’re market opportunities. These are often drivers of your growth strategies.\nA: Threats are external factors that might limit your organization from reaching its objectives or goals. Threats are external factors outside your organization, like competitor trends, economic trends, or social trends.\nA: The most challenging part of your SWOT analysis is looking at your internal and external data to decide what indeed are your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. We recommend looking at objective data to help make these decisions. Opinions can be great, but they shouldn’t be the foundation of your SWOT.",

    "domain": "techcrunch.com",
    "age": "1,420 days ago",
    "content": "In the latest spark from its fast evolving tech ecosystem, Spain’s scale-ups are banding together to lobby lawmakers and press the economic case for their high-tech, high-growth business model more broadly.\nThe new lobby group, called EsTech (aka ‘Es’ for España), had its official launch last week — when it unveiled nine founding company members spanning a range of industries, including gig platforms, B2B software, energy, entertainment and health tech — namely: Cabify, Factorial, Filmin, Glovo, Wallbox, Holaluz, Neuroelectrics, Jobandtalent and Red Points.\nThe group wants to create the conditions for a new IBEX35 based in tech as EsTech’s president told local journalists covering the launch — so the idea is for it to grow substantially in size too.\nThe hope is that many more of Spain’s 400+ fast growing startups will soon get big and ambitious enough to join the program, according to Carina Szpilka, a general partner at the Madrid-based VC firm, K Fund, and president of the broader Adigital digital business association which is supporting EsTech’s launch, alongside another local trade group, Endeavor, and the Spanish VC association, Ascri.\nOther fast growing Spanish startups Typeform, Travel Perk, Heura Foods and Wallapop are suggested as likely candidates to be next in line to join the club.\n“We are convinced that the contribution of these type of companies, especially the scale-ups, is super significant to the prosperity and to the economic growth of the country. That’s why we started to talk to them, we started to approach them and we started to also share the vision that we want for our country for the future and this is how this initiative was born,” Szpilka tells TechCrunch.\nAdigital expects Spain to have 20 unicorns by the end of the year. And, seeking to underscore the value to the economy of such high growth startups, Szpilka says that even just that handful of billion-dollar+ valuation tech firms would be contributing 1% of the country’s GDP.\nSave up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit\n1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling. Learn from founders and investors who have shaped the industry. Connect with peers navigating similar growth stages. Walk away with tactics you can apply immediately.\nOffer ends March 13.\nSave up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit\n1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling. Learn from founders and investors who have shaped the industry. Connect with peers navigating similar growth stages. Walk away with tactics you can apply immediately\nOffer ends March 13.\nThe wider ecosystem of circa 450 scale-ups that EsTech intends to represent will have a goal of reaching 40% tech GDP in 2030.\n“The [goal for EsTech] is to really facilitate the creation and the growth of these type of companies — becoming unicorns or not. I don’t care about the $1BN valuation; we care about job creation, sales, the ‘social cash flow’ that these type of companies can contribute,” she adds.\n“Under the radar”\nSpain’s high growth startups have been a bit “under the radar” domestically when it comes to positive perception of their impact, Szpilka suggests. “People really didn’t realize the impact that these type of companies are having. And which we are convinced is huge. Last year — in terms of sales — this group of [nine EsTech founding] companies were more than €4 billion in sales and in terms of job creation they employ currently 10,000 people directly here in Spain.”\nShe also cites job creation stats for the broader base of 400 or so scale-ups in the Spanish ecosystem which, in 2020, were responsible for creating 324,000 new jobs. “The expectation for 2021 — which is not confirmed yet — is going to be around 670,000 employments. So we are talking about a huge percentage already of the employed population in Spain.”\n“It’s really impressive the impact and we are convinced that by sharing and making the society be aware of the contribution this will create a positive impact,” Szpilka adds.\nEsTech’s three main objectives boil down to advocacy around 1) talent — both promoting talent development within Spain and attracting more international talent to the country (which means lobbying on related tax regimes); 2) regulation, seeking to influence domestic initiatives such as Spain’s new startup law but also at an EU-level where regional digital policy gets set; and 3) raising the profile of scale-ups on the global tech stage and also locally where entrepreneurs don’t always get the warmest reception from wider Spanish society.\nOn the regulation point, Spain’s first startup law — which was adopted in draft and presented to parliament in December — has been well received by the local tech community. But there has also been some grumbling that the thresholds for qualifying for the package of tax breaks and other benefits are drawn too narrowly — and will exclude all but very early stage startups.\nEsTech seems likely to press that line of argument — although at the time of writing it was still preparing its policy plan.\n‘We are going to create the best environment for startups in Europe’\n“We are leveraging on the new startup law and also trying to bring to the floor some of the best practices around Europe — some of them have already been presented in the new startup law, others no. So we are going to take this as a base scenario and try to propose different improvements,” says Szpilka. “Particularly because there are some things around the startup laws that are just for very small startups but here we are talking about scale ups and here we also want to be listened to.”\n“We need to work all around the different stages,” she adds — pointing to another draft law, called Crea y Crece, which is more focused on SMEs than tech businesses, and saying EsTech’s mission is therefore “more to make sure and make everybody aware of how important the contribution of the tech world could also be”.\n“Many, many times I am complaining about the innovation capacity of Spain as a whole — the contribution to innovation around the percentage of the GDP in Spain is one of the lowest in Europe but at the same time we have this type of super innovate companies and this should also be an example for other companies in Spain of how you can innovate here and we would love others to see this as a mirror of the type of things that can be done here,” she adds.\nOn the third objective — raising the profile and perhaps burnishing the image of scale-ups within Spain — the always vocal and sometimes violent protests by taxi associations in cities like Madrid and Barcelona, demonstrating against ride-hailing platforms such as EsTech member Cabify, which are seen as encroaching on rights and livelihoods, look instructive vis-a-vis some of the challenges the group may face in trying to push a positive message of disruption.\n“Sometimes in Spain the entrepreneurs — the empresarios how we call them — that are business people have a sort of a bad ‘image’,” says Szpilka. “The entrepreneurs are always looked at as super fancy and smart people but at the end of the day we are the same. So it’s trying to boost and trying to explain the role that entrepreneurs are playing and their capacity to impact, to transform and to change the society in which we are living.”\nEsTech’s lobbying will presumably seek to establish and/or reframe the narrative around high growth platforms to one of opportunity, job and wealth creation.\nReframe because certain types of digital scaling in Spain have been fast-followed by negative stories — especially on the gig economy front, where public concern over issues like the rise of precarious jobs has already led to regulatory reforms.\nThe country’s center-left government agreed a labor reform targeted at delivery platforms last year which requires them to recognize couriers as employees — although, months on, many local gig workers still haven’t been brought in-house by the platforms they deliver for. And when the labor reform came into force, Glovo — another of EsTech’s founding companies — said it would only hire around 1,800 couriers of the ~10,000 active on its platform in its home market. (As of last October, the company hadn’t even hired that fractional amount yet.)\nIn just one example of synergies and aligned interests within EsTech’s club of scale-ups, another of the founding companies, the digital temping agency Jobandtalent, has seen its business valuation soar over the past decade — hitting $2.35 billion last December when it closed a $500 million Series E — exactly on rising demand for what it bills as a workforce-as-a-service platform that essentially offers a fresh legal workaround for high growth platforms like Glovo which want to keep scaling an on-demand delivery business without having to directly employ thousands of couriers as Spain’s labor reform intends.\nThe European Union also recently presented a platform worker reform — saying at the end of last year that it would establish a framework to tackle bogus self employment. The final shape of that pan-EU regulation is still pending the bloc’s co-legislative process so the opportunity for lobbying to influence the detail remains live.\nAs EU eyes ‘balance’ on precarious gig work, Glovo offers pledge of ‘fairer’ conditions for couriers\nIn Brussels, other major pieces of digital regulation are being fast slotted into place too, with political agreement on an ex ante reform of the bloc’s competition regime (aka, the DMA, which will apply only to the very largest tech giants) recently secured via EU trilogues — and a broader update of the bloc’s ecommerce rules (aka, the DSA) now going through this three-way negotiation process.\nThe final shape of the DSA will certainly impact how Spain’s scale-ups operate in the future. While the DMA could bolster the chances of European tech giants being able to compete against global (i.e. mostly U.S.) Big Tech giants at the pan-EU level.\nAlbeit, any one of these Spanish scale-ups could — in theory — grow big enough to, one day, end up designed a gatekeeper themselves — and face being subject to the DMA’s fixed regime of operational ‘dos and don’ts’. Which introduces a new type of cap that scale-ups and their investors may need to consider.\n“At the end, the EU has a lot to say in this economy,” agrees Szpilka, adding: “Of course we are talking to Spanish regulators and to the administration here in Spain but EU will be a focus for sure as most of the important things that are coming — Digital Markets Act and other regulations around Digital Services Act — are in Europe.\n“Sometimes we think that these regulations only affect the big guys in tech but it’s more frequent than we think that they are also affecting these scale up companies.”\nSuper scalers?\nAs more scale-ups join EsTech the opportunities to align their respective growth-focused agendas to better amplify shared interests to lawmakers will surely grow — although it’s less clear how successful the domestic bid to re-pitch high growth, high tech businesses to a sometimes sceptical Spanish public will be if socioeconomic divides persist.\nIt’s notable that the government chain-linked its announcement of a 10-year “entrepreneurial nation” strategy to a very public commitment that no part of Spanish society would be left behind in the scramble to digitally transform its economic model. (Or “an ironclad principle that we leave no one behind”, as prime minister Pedro Sanchez put at his Web Summit announcement in December 2020.)\nSo it is perhaps not so surprising that a handful of the largest, fastest growing Spanish scale-ups have responded, fairly quickly, to the government coming with a long term, socially inclusive digital strategy by organizing among themselves — with the goal of ensuring their own interests don’t get put on the backburner.\nAna Maiques, founder of the health tech scale-up Neuroelectrics and president of EsTech, says the group wants to make sure the needs of these “new kids on the block” businesses are heard by Spain’s institutions and policymakers, while simultaneously shouting about scale-up successes internationally to raise the country’s profile on the global stage.\n“I’m spending most of my professional life in the US. There is no connection between ‘Es’ — Spain — and ‘tech’ so this is one of the things that we really want to shout about. We want to show to the world that there is high tech and amazing technology companies being born and growing from Spain,” she tells TechCrunch. “We really believe that the trade associations that exist today in Spain may not represent this new model.\n“Some societies — like my American colleagues — are really good on the selling and speaking and marketing side. I think that in Spain we are quite the opposite. There’s a lot of value, there is a lot of interesting things happening and we don’t speak enough about it — so this is also a recognition from my point of view to those hidden heroes that go under the radar but they are doing extraordinary things.\n“If you think of an example like Wallbox, they weren’t even created six years ago — they are 1,000 people today and they went into the Nasdaq. First Spanish company to go into the Nasdaq. They have factories in Texas and China and they are revolutionizing these new electric car plugs. This is a super clear example that we should be proud of. Born and created in Spain. So we want our society to understand that these things are happening here and we want to be part of that community and play the Champion’s League at the world level. We are as good as others so now is the moment to be proud of what’s happening already here.”\n“These companies regardless of who is in their cap table or who are their investors or whether they are at the Nasdaq or in the national stock market, they are bringing thousands of jobs into the countries,” Meiques continues. “So I think that’s one of our biggest social and economical impacts. I think we really have the power, these kind of companies, to transform the economy and the people we employ are high level employees, people with engineering degrees, highly technological.”\nShe also points to the EU’s commitment, over ten years, to put €10 billion into investing in scale up companies across the bloc as an opportunity for EsTech to lean out towards regional policies as well as inwards to make the case for disruptive business models locally.\n“In these kind of associations you need to work both at local and global levels,” she adds. “We need to attract talent — which of course will be from Spain but it will be from all over the world because the war of this decade is going to be on talent.\n“The other thing that we need is investment. Here the legislators and the regulation has a lot to say to make also the process more streamlined for investors to help us scale up companies. All the tax incentives. It’s difficult, currently, to invest in Spain compared to other jurisdictions like the U.S.”\nThe startup law recently proposed by the government as part of its “Spain entrepreneurial nation strategy” contains a package of reform measures aimed at attracting more tech talent, such as through changes to the visa system and tax regime, as well as interventions focused on pulling in more investment.\nBut EsTech evidently wants to see more and deeper support — support that stretches with startups as they scale.\n“There are interesting initiatives — like the newest Next Tech Fund that the government launched [last summer] particularly for deeptech companies in Spain — but we need many more of these,” says Szpilka, suggesting Spain has major strengths and growth potential in data startups, clean tech and health. Connectivity is another area she highlights for further growth.\n“What makes us very unique is we have a very diverse culture in Spain and very entrepreneurial,” adds Meiques. “And that builds a different kind of view into the world — we’ve got this very perseverant, passionate, fighter character… So I think, as a culture, we have the ingredients of creativity and perseverance to be fantastic entrepreneurs. And on the science side I also believe there is a lot of strong universities and labs in Spain which are also under the radar.\n“So there’s this combination and I think that maybe what we are lacking is ambition — and a belief that we can be a player.”\nIn the short term, the mission for EsTech is to scale itself by growing its membership. The group will need to add many more high growth tech businesses than its initial cohort of nine to turn up the volume on its claim to being the voice of scale-ups in Spain — so local founders’ appetites for agenda-setting ambition (or at least coordination) are set to be tested.\n“We already know there are at least ten more [fast growing startups] that are pretty similar to the nine founder members so those will be the first ones we’ll be calling up,” says Meiques. “And then of course we expect as companies grow and scale and comply with the association that they will join us. So as Carina was saying the idea is to grow our contribution to the economic model and the GDP of the country. The more the merrier.”\nThe criteria for scale-ups to qualify to join EsTech includes being at least post-Series B or C in terms of funding stage; with a consolidated annual growth rate of more than 25%-50%; and an “international approach” — so doing business outside as well as inside Spain, per Szpilka, although the main base of the company’s operations or founders’ must be located in the country.\nAn acquisition of an EsTech scale-up by a foreign giant wouldn’t necessarily cancel membership — hence Glovo, which was recently acquired by Germany-based rival Delivery Hero, can still claim a place as a founding member as it retains its local HQ and extensive operations in Spain.\nSpain’s ten-year plan to put startups in the economic driving seat",

    "title": "The 10 Pillars of Employee Engagement in 2026 | Empuls",
    "domain": "blog.empuls.io",
    "age": "1,420 days ago",
    "content": "On this page\nEmployee engagement defines an employee's emotional commitment and responsibility towards their work and the employer. A Gallup report has concluded that 23% of employees feel engaged at work.\nDespite the trends, Gallup has also showcased the need to strengthen the pillars of employee engagement, as empirical evidence suggests that higher levels of engagement have a profound impact on an organization’s success.\nTherefore, it is disappointing that only 15% of global employees (and only 35% in the US) consider themselves engaged.\nAccording to a Deloitte report, employee engagement affects several areas: productivity, revenues, performance, and even employee retention.\nTherefore, companies must improve employee engagement to optimize the enormous latent potential of a more engaged workforce.\nManagement must focus on understanding the causes of employee engagement and seek ways to eliminate the barriers to better employee-company alignment.\n10 most important pillars of employee engagement\nSome considerations for better employee enablement are:\n1. Communication\nCommunication lies at the heart of any effort to improve engagement and to create a positive company culture. It engenders trust, transparency and enhances worker morale. Effective communication requires calibrating plans to respond to employee feedback.\nAssuming that employees have what they need to do a good job can be a fatal flaw. And not acknowledging employee needs or impediments can snowball into more caustic problems like poor morale.\nToday, communication also means incorporating various technology tools and creating safe spaces for candid non-threatening conversations. Remote and hybrid work is creating a new emphasis on innovative ways to enhance communication.\nCompanies would do well to institute some ground rules for their communication protocols lest communication becomes a perpetual activity required at all times of the day and night. Yes, that means beginning with communicating about how and when to communicate!\n2. Work environment\nIn an era where work environments are the subject of online employee reviews on sites like Glassdoor, negative feedback can impede employee retention and hiring. Toxic settings are easily identified and highlight poor employee engagement.\nNon-engaged employees are unenthusiastic about their work and are most likely to leave at a moment’s notice. They also tend to poison the well and be highly critical of a company that does not meet their needs. Their negative influence invariably manifests itself in poor team performance and adverse customer interactions.\n3. Collaboration\nAnd while you obviously cannot force employees to be friends, you can create more opportunities for casual interactions to encourage such bonds to be established. Teams, where individuals get on with each other, tend to be happier and more productive.\nThe new hybrid work environment means that all employees are not likely to be in one place, as was the case pre-pandemic. Effective collaboration requires the selection of the right digital tools for a dispersed workforce.\nIn this respect, technology companies have done a yeoman’s job and have had great success in facilitating the future of work in trying circumstances. There are a plethora of options. Zoom is now a verb!\n4. Rewards and incentives\nRewards and incentives are an essential part of the employee engagement toolbox. But a lot has changed post-pandemic. Not surprisingly, employees have a somewhat different take on their expectations from work.\nThe post-pandemic era allows companies to rethink total rewards and make changes to employees’ financial and non-financial rewards to fit this new environment.\nAppreciating employees, particularly when they are going above and beyond, is a powerful incentive to continue to do better. It shows that managers are noticing their excellent work and rewarding it.\nEven before the pandemic, the American Psychological Association estimated that more than $500 billion was lost due to workplace stress. Stressed employees also tend to have higher absenteeism and higher turnover. And turnovers are costly.\nThe Center for American Progress estimates that replacing a single employee costs approximately 20% of that employee’s salary.\nThe stresses of 2020 have put renewed focus on employee wellbeing. Wellness programs as employee enablement incentives have always provided a great return on investment, but now, 86% of organizations have a dedicated budget for workplace wellbeing. Rewards are changing.\n5. Personal development\nIn the current setting, technology allows for more training and reskilling options than ever before. When employees are happy, engaged, and feel supported by their leadership and management, they tend to produce their best work.\nEngagement is about the individual’s personal development, but it is helpful to remember that employee development directly benefits the organization too.\nA culture where continuous learning is encouraged creates agile organizations that move at the speed of the competition and the market. Not leveraging these learning options for employees is a poor excuse for employers and can cause existential threats to the company.\n6. Role definition\nEmployees need to understand and articulate management’s expectations of them if they are to succeed. Providing such clarity needs to be the responsibility of the manager. When positions are unclear, employees don’t know how their work contributes to success, leading to confusion and frustration.\nIn the new models for the future of work, role definitions tend to emphasize the end product/service. Expectations and even delegation of tasks now need to be redefined for this new reality.\nFinally, now more than ever, the work and role definition must fit into the employee’s expectations of their own lives. Understanding the individual’s personal choices and helping them connect those objectives with the company goals is paramount.\n7. Support from leadership\nEmployee engagement requires board and management buy-in and investment. Employees need to see that their C-Suite is vested in the success of the engagement strategies and plans. Only then will they trust the effort and commit themselves to the engagement framework.\nGallup’s data (see below) shows that engaged employees work safer, work longer, produce better quality products and services and lead to higher company profitability.\nThis sampling of outcomes should remove any doubts about why leadership and management should not enthusiastically support and encourage better employee engagement. It directly impacts the bottom line!\n8. Alignment with company goals\nIncreasingly, employees are not just satisfied with a paycheck. They want to find meaning and purpose in what they do, including in meaningful work. The younger generations now entering the workforce are even more focused on this aspect of their lives.\nHelping employees understand how their work affects the bigger picture is a crucial role of managers. Performance reviews should focus on ways in which an employee can better meet the objectives of the organization.\n9. Surveys/feedback\nYou will not fix the problems of employee engagement until you have determined why it is occurring. Surveys are a handy tool in determining what is deficient by giving everyone a chance to provide input and reassure staff that you are taking their feedback seriously.\nListening is great, but you also need data. Surveys help you collect that data. There are many options in the marketplace for employee surveys. One such tool comes from Xoxoday and incorporates both eNPS and engagement methodologies.\nBaselining the various components of employee engagement and then using KPIs to evaluate feedback and progress is critical. Ensuring employees opine whether they have the resources, tools, and technology to do their jobs well is essential feedback.\nOnce-and-done does not provide the continuous always-listening mode that provides the best data and results.\nAnd remember, you will do more damage to company culture if you do nothing about what your employees are telling you. Feedback needs to spur you to action and not into an “analysis paralysis.”\n10. Growth opportunities/mentoring\nEmployees are looking for ways to add value to their work and positively impact their career progression. Managers need to encourage employees to achieve higher performance with effective coaching techniques and employee training opportunities.\nSome of this is a function of encouraging trusted conversations where employees are not fearful of the consequences of what they might say.\nManagers who have continuous conversations with employees and clarify how an individual’s work leads to organizational success are likely to create more enthusiastic and engaged employees.\nIt is a familiar adage that people quit managers, not their jobs. Managers should improve their ability to show empathy to their employees.\nIn Give and Take, Prof. Adam Grant of Wharton demonstrates how a leader’s kindness can be a powerful indicator of team success and enables employees to perform at optimum levels.\nHow Xoxoday's employee engagement platform strengthens all 10 pillars\nCreating a culture where employees are truly engaged isn’t just about perks or paychecks—it’s about building deep connections across the key pillars that drive fulfillment, motivation, and purpose at work. That’s exactly what Xoxoday's employee engagement platform, Empuls is built for.\nEmpuls is a comprehensive, AI-powered employee engagement platform that enables HR leaders and managers to proactively strengthen every pillar of engagement with smart tools, automation, and meaningful experiences. It’s not just software—it’s the backbone of a people-first culture.\nHere’s how Empuls brings the 10 pillars of employee engagement to life:\n- Leadership: Empuls gives leaders a platform to be visible, transparent, and inspiring. Whether it's through townhalls, shoutouts, or AMAs (Ask Me Anything), leaders can connect authentically and regularly with every level of the organization.\n- Communication: Internal comms teams can keep everyone aligned and informed through a modern social intranet. Share updates, celebrate wins, run polls, and spark conversations in a way that feels natural and inclusive.\n- Recognition: Turn everyday moments into celebrations. Empuls powers peer-to-peer recognition, milestone awards, and real-time appreciation with smart nudges that prompt managers and employees to recognize great work when it happens.\n- Well-being: Support holistic wellness with curated perks, early access to earned wages, wellness allowances, and tax-saving fringe benefits—all from one platform. Because when employees feel taken care of, they give their best.\n- Growth: Celebrate learning and development milestones with customized rewards and shoutouts. Empuls helps reinforce a culture of continuous growth with recognition tied to upskilling, certifications, and personal progress.\n- Purpose: Empuls makes it easy to tie engagement efforts back to company values and mission. Employees can redeem rewards for charitable donations, participate in CSR campaigns, and earn badges for living your values.\n- Autonomy: Give employees the freedom to choose how they engage. From selecting rewards to customizing communication preferences, Empuls puts the power of personalization in every user’s hands.\n- Work-life balance: Enable flexibility and balance with benefits that support remote work, family care, travel, and personal wellness. Empuls helps you show employees you value their life outside work just as much.\n- Feedback: Empuls makes employee listening easy and impactful. Launch pulse, eNPS, and lifecycle surveys, and use built-in analytics to uncover insights and take action—faster.\n- Connection: Strengthen peer connections through community groups, wishboards, celebrations, and shared experiences. Empuls helps employees feel like part of something bigger, no matter where they work.\nWith powerful integrations, white-label branding, and AI-driven insights, you get a platform that evolves with your culture.\n👉 Ready to empower your people and elevate engagement across all pillars?\n💬 Talk to an expert today.\nClosing\nThe evidence strongly suggests that an engaged workforce is critical to an organization’s success. In a recent Deloitte survey, executives were clear about how they rated employee engagement.\nFortunately, some of the recent metrics on employee engagement have been encouraging. Gallup reports that employee engagement was up 39% in January 2021, and even younger generations are participating in this uptick.\nThe most frequent mistake made by organizations is to make employee engagement the sole responsibility of the HR department. Unfortunately, if engagement does not permeate the entire organization, particularly among managers and leaders, low engagement continues to be a persistent problem with the accompanying negative fallout.\nAnd even though that still leaves many companies without employee engagement as a priority, it is a definite improvement.\nAs the benefits become more evident, expect more companies to embrace employee engagement and consider additional strategies to improve it.",

    "content": "In October of 2008, I wrote a blog Even in a difficult economy Customer Service can Make a Difference! My car wash customer was looking to improve his business during the summer, due to skyrocketing gas prices. The solution: measure customer satisfaction. Autopia Car Wash in California was one of the first customers I shared Fred Reichheld’s Ultimate question, Net Promoter Score (NPS).\nThe Autopia Car Wash story shows how effective NPS can be to improve your business.\nCan You Measure Achieving Your Core Purpose?\nIn Winning on Purpose, Fred Reichheld believes customer satisfaction(NPS) measures fulfilling your Core Purpose. The data he shares provides evidence, organizations who achieve the highest customer satisfaction scores succeed at a higher rate than Jim Collins’ Good to Great Companies.\nReichheld believes the highest purpose of a business is to serve its customers “One common denominator that a lot of us human beings seem to share is the desire to live a life of meaning and purpose—to make this world a better place.”\nMartin Luther King Jr. quote: “Everybody can be great, because everybody can serve.”\nReichheld believes meaningful service to others should be the true measure of greatness. It should be your businesses’ ultimate goal.\nBecause “meaningful service to others” has been difficult to measure, businesses default to easily measured financial metrics for gauging greatness.\nA company can’t be great without embracing a great purpose. (Download quotes on the value of purpose)\nWhen profits become purpose, it’s too easy for large and powerful firms to boost their financial performance by shortchanging customers and employees.\nGood to Great Companies Performance VS. NPS Leaders\nReichheld shares data from Good to Great measuring performance against companies who lead in NPS performance.\nCompare the graphs. Good to Great companies delivered only 40 percent of the median market performance, while The Ultimate Question 2.0 NPS exemplars delivered 510 percent of the median return.\nEight of the eleven Good to Great companies lagged the US median (1/1/2001–12/31/2010)\nAll eleven NPS leaders beat the US median (1/1/2011–12/31/2020)\nGood to Great employed a financial capitalist mindset, defining greatness in terms of financial results.\nReichheld recommends measuring greatness against the standard of a winning purpose.\nCollins emphasized leaders concentrate where they have passion (Hedgehog Concept). Net Promoter concludes the primary purpose worthy of passion—and the one that consistently wins—centers on enriching customer lives.\nCollins’s famous flywheel won’t keep spinning unless it is powered by loyalty economics, an insight Good to Great may have overlooked.\nCustomer Capitalism – Net Purpose Score\nReichheld believes firms who practice customer capitalism—putting customer interests first—achieve sustainable greatness.\nFirms that make customers feel loved are winning; they outpace and outgrow competitors.\nReichheld notes, when Apple Store founder Ron Johnson designed their successful retail outlets, he was inspired by Jesus’s advice to “Love thy neighbor as thyself,” which Johnson considers to be the essential message of the Bible.\nJohnson explained his goal was to “design a store based on love.”\nEvery Apple Store employee badge proclaims this purpose: “to enrich the lives of employees so they can enrich the lives of customers.”\nHe designed the operation to emphasize service and education above sales. He invested in real-time customer feedback and avoided commission-driven compensation typical in electronics retailing.\n“We treat customers the way they’d like to be treated—with warmth, helpfulness, empathy, and incredible service.”\nApple designed its system to energize frontline employees and help them learn how to innovate to enrich customer lives.\nThe best way to have happy customers.\nHave happy employees.\nThese are not mutually exclusive!\nNPS helps employees consistently enrich the lives they touch. That is the purpose of great organizations. Designed and deployed correctly, NPS can become an organization’s Net Purpose Score to gauge progress toward living your purpose.\nReichheld’s recommendation. Use NPS as a tool not just for measuring customer loyalty; employ NPS as a practical moral compass for your organization.\nRackspace CEO Lanham Napier, “I think of NPS as a GPS [Global Positioning System] for greatness,” he said. “It lets our teams know how often they are achieving great results for our customers.”\nOne of the most important gifts a leader can provide is to help your team know when they have touched greatness—by providing extraordinary service to others.\nNPS can illuminate your best path forward toward greatness—defined as “enriching customer lives.”\nLeaders and organizations are great when they help team members lead great lives.\nThat’s purpose energizes everybody in the organization.\nTo create an environment where everyone is inspired to give their best, contact Positioning Systems today to schedule a free exploratory meeting.\nGrowth demands Strategic Discipline.\nBuilding an enduring great organization requires disciplined people, disciplined thought, disciplined action, superior results, producing a distinctive impact in the world.\nDiscipline sustains momentum, over a long period of time, laying the foundations for lasting endurance.\nA winning habit starts with 3 Strategic Disciplines: Priority, Metrics, and Meeting Rhythms. Forecasting, accountability, individual, and team performance improve dramatically.\nMeeting Rhythms achieve a disciplined focus on performance metrics to drive growth.\nLet Positioning Systems help your business achieve these outcomes on the Four most Important Decisions your business faces:\n|\nDECISION |\nRESULT/OUTCOME |\n|\nPEOPLE |\n|\n|\nSTRATEGY |\n|\n|\nEXECUTION |\n|\n|\nCASH |\nPositioning Systems helps mid-sized ($5M - $250M+) business Scale-UP.

Take our Four Decisions Needs Assessment to discover how your business measures against other Scaled Up companies. We’ll contact you.\nNEXT BLOG – Be Remarkable, Not Merely Satisfactory\nPeter Drucker, the father of modern management wrote, “to satisfy the customer is the mission and purpose of every business.” Fred Reichheld disagrees. The purpose of a great business is to enrich customers’ lives. Enriching customers’ lives means delivering experiences so remarkable they feel loved; they tell others about it. You wow customers.

    "content": "Summary.\nWhen a person sizes up a complex situation and comes to a rapid decision that proves to be not just good but brilliant, you think, “That was smart.” After you’ve watched him do this a few times, you realize you’re in the presence of something special. It’s not raw brainpower, though that helps. It’s not emotional intelligence, either, though that, too, is often involved. It’s deep smarts, the stuff that produces that mysterious quality, good judgment. Those who have deep smarts can see the whole picture and yet zoom in on a specific problem others haven’t been able to diagnose. Almost intuitively, they can make the right decision, at the right level, with the right people. The manager who understands when and how to move into a new international market, the executive who knows just what kind of talk to give when her organization is in crisis, the technician who can track a product failure back to an interaction between independently produced elements—these are people whose knowledge would be hard to purchase on the open market. Their insight is based more on know-how than on facts; it comprises a system view as well as expertise in individual areas.

    "description": "Reprint: R0409F When a person sizes up a complex situation and rapidly comes to a decision that proves to be not just good but brilliant, you think, “That was smart.” After you watch him do this a few times, you realize you’re in the presence of something special. It’s not raw brainpower, though that helps. It’s not emotional intelligence, either, though that, too, is often involved. It’s deep smarts.

    "domain": "bvp.com",
    "age": "1,470 days ago",
    "content": "Roadmap: 10 laws of cloud\nByron Deeter, Elliott Robinson, Mary D'Onofrio and the firm release the laws on how to build and scale cloud companies.\nIntroduction\nEarly founders and CEOs helped us synthesize the industry’s best thinking when Bessemer penned its Original 10 Laws of Cloud Computing in 2008.\nSince then so much has changed. Not only are there over 100 public and private cloud companies already valued over $1 billion, but also the cloud now drives three of the most valuable companies in the world—Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet (Google).\nAs for Bessemer, we’re grateful to be working with over 200 cloud companies—and we’re just getting started.\nThat’s why we’re dedicating this eleventh anniversary edition to the pioneers who tested new frameworks and defined the benchmarks to “pay it forward” to those reading this today.\nLaw 1: In the cloud economy, scale wins\nMarket leaders generally command over 50% of the total market’s enterprise value; second place captures less than 30%, and third place is lucky to get 20%. Scale creates a virtuous cycle with pricing power and talent that reinforces a company’s lead, further expanding the distance between the market leader and the rest of the competitive set. Investors also give market-leading assets premium valuations, which lower their costs of capital.\nExpand your company's TAM with a Second Act to dominate the market.\nTherefore, a methodology to expand your core TAM through a Second Act is powerful and necessary. Building and maintaining scale requires constant product innovation. This might involve launching an entirely new product, addressing functional adjacencies, or providing deeper capabilities for existing customers.\nLayering on payment solutions, moving to mobile, or monetizing a data set are some of the most effective Second Acts we’ve seen from cloud companies. While a Second Act will be different from company to company, what remains consistent is the fact that a market leader is able to paint a compelling and broad picture of its product, and eventually, its platform.\nLaw 2: Growth at optimal cost\nEfficient growth is when growth in topline revenue reflects the dollars invested in the business. Companies with large existing market opportunities can justify higher burn rates if they also have rapid customer and revenue growth rates. For market creators, businesses must keep burn low as buyers emerge and revenue grows.\nWhen it comes to revenue growth in the early stages of a company, efficient growth is more important than profitability.\nFinding the right balance between growth rate and burn rate will evolve over time as leadership emerges, go-to-market strategies become more efficient, and cost of capital goes down.\nFor growth stage startups earning less than $30 million ARR, efficient growth is defined by net new ARR over net burn (optimal score being >1.5).\nLonger term, cloud companies should focus on maximizing their efficiency scores, calculated as ARR growth plus FCF margin of ARR.\nAcross The BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index (^EMCLOUD)—the benchmark for public cloud companies—the average efficiency score is approximately 45%.\nLaw 3: Invest behind the cloud sales and marketing learning curve\nThe first rule of running sales organizations is to ramp only what works. In traditional outbound sales, do not hire more salespeople until you have two or three account executives hitting their quotas without much support. For inbound sales, align hiring to match the company’s lead velocity rate.\nCompanies that invest in sales and marketing too early will see headcount burn increase without the associated topline growth, and sales rep quality will drop as company targets and quotas are missed.\nExperiment with the sales and marketing model. Prove it’s the right match for the business before scaling hiring efforts.\nExperiment early and often on what does work, such as trying new lead and demand generation tactics, burst testing channels, and combining different functional experts on a sales team, including business development reps, sales development reps, account executives, support engineers, and more.\nHowever, only invest behind the systems that have the best marginal productivity of the incremental dollar now, and only do so when you have a sales motion that is truly repeatable.\nLaw 4: Product as a competitive advantage\nThe best product is (finally) winning. In the past, excellent sales execution could obfuscate product deficiencies, and compelling marketing campaigns could convince a non-user decision maker to select one software product over another on behalf of his or her team. But today, few people would ever buy or implement new software without reviewing online testimonials and case studies, talking to peers, and conducting UX and technical assessments of other competitors.\nToday’s product-first evaluations drive powerful bottoms up distribution models, and many of these companies build $1 billion businesses. Sales leaders don’t determine market leadership, but product leaders do. If this doesn’t describe your company, find the quickest path to improve your product to catalyze customer sales.\nFocus on building an outstanding proprietary product because it’s the primary thing that wins (and keeps) customers.\nGenerally, products that capture market share deliver consumer-like UX (including onboarding), offer both web and mobile solutions, integrate into all of the core applications necessary, and offer adjacent features that competitors already do or will soon offer. We also strongly recommend adopting an API-first development philosophy so development teams do not waste their time (and CapEx money) reinventing services that already exist as APIs. Engineering resources should only focus on building an outstanding proprietary product.\nLaw 5: Master the 5 C's of cloud finance\nTop performing companies track and report on these financial cloud metrics because they are the clearest lenses into the vitality of the business.\n1. Committed Annual Recurring Revenue (CARR)\nThis is the single most important metric for a cloud business to monitor, as the change in CARR growth provides the clearest visibility into the health of any cloud business. CARR is defined as contracted, but not yet live ARR, plus live ARR netted against known projected ARR churn.\n2. Cash Flow\nCompanies live or die based on their cash management, and it’s necessary that cloud companies track burn rate closely. Comparing burn rate to topline growth allows companies to understand what growth initiatives are working (or not), where headcount can be added (or subtracted), and what financings are required. We often find that the most successful cloud companies will provide discounts and sweeteners for payment of cash up front.\n3. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Payback Period\nCAC payback is the time period needed to fully repay your sales and marketing expenses, on a gross margin adjusted basis. CAC payback periods for SMB customers should be approximately 6-18 months whereas enterprise customers can be as long as 24-36 months. It’s often difficult to fund growth when CAC payback is more than 36 months unless CLTV is exceptionally high.\n4. Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)\nCLTV is the net present value of the recurring profit streams of a given customer minus the acquisition cost of that customer. CLTV is calculated by taking the contract value (adjusted based on a customer’s expected duration or upsell rate), multiplied by gross margin, with CAC subtracted. Tracking CLTV based on customer segments will help identify the most efficient channels, so teams can segment sales and customer success efforts. As a rule of thumb, CLTV/CAC should be 3x or more.\n5. Churn\nLong term profitability, and thus valuation, is impacted by the renewal rate of your customers. Top enterprise companies benefit from annual logo churn rates (gross churn) below 7% and CARR renewal rates above 100% (net negative churn). SMB-focused companies often have higher churn rates (often approximately 20% gross) and lower CLTV. However, the shorter sales cycles and lower CAC still make the CLTV/CAC equation compelling.\nCARR, cash flow, and churn tend to be highly dynamic metrics and thus should be checked daily or weekly, whereas CAC and CLTV are longer term and typically checked quarterly.\nLaw 6: Discover your secret KPIs\nWhile the five C’s of cloud finance comprise the foundational financial dashboard for most successful and enduring cloud companies, every business benefits from discovering a unique KPI that provides more granularity into customer behavior and product performance. “North Stars” are highly variable and depend entirely on a company’s unique value proposition.\nGreat cloud companies have a bespoke metric (or multiple) that is a leading indicator of success.\nAmazon is famous for having metrics specific to each of its product areas, and having detailed data oriented discussions around each. Twilio focused on “messages sent” in its early years. DocuSign tracked the number of signed envelopes, while Shopify tracked customer GMV as leading indicators of future business value. For other companies, North Stars may be related to product metrics or API calls.\nChoose a metric that works for your business and remember that North Stars are generally leading indicators of product usage, and therefore revenue. Aligning your company to this “true north” is like providing a compass that guides roadmaps and prioritization so everyone is working in the same direction.\nLaw 7: Customer success is company success\nEarly on in a company’s life cycle, new logo additions are paramount; however, long term, renewals and upsells become the biggest inputs into enterprise value and company success.\nA one percent change in monthly renewal rates will result in more than a $100 million difference in your valuation at IPO, and even more over time. Similarly, a renewal dollar of ARR is cheaper to acquire than a new logo dollar of ARR since customer acquisition costs of upsell are lower than those of net new customers.\nThe best enterprise companies have less than 1% monthly gross churn and better than 100% net expansion.\nEven a mature sales organization cannot add new logo ARR fast enough to keep up with a “leaky bucket” company that isn’t retaining existing ARR, and it certainly cannot sustain the average 30%+ growth rates that characterize the best public cloud software companies today. This becomes even harder at scale, as the base over which you are trying to grow approximately 30% or more becomes larger.\nHigh performing customer success teams align people and processes tightly against the metrics that matter most to the executive team. Track user adoption, NPS, and engagement closely as leading indicators of retention. Customer Success gets ahead of issues and helps fine tune product roadmaps in order to improve customer loyalty over time.\nLaw 8: Impact through engagement or insights\nHistorically, software solutions proved their value through high engagement rates and “time in app” by their users. Many modern cloud businesses have achieved great success by following this model and becoming compelling systems of engagement. However, a second path to success emerges as some systems now deliver results and valuable insights to end users, often requiring very little “time in app.”\nEffective software can be either a system of results or a system of engagement; both models deliver compelling ROIs in very different ways.\nA black box, quantitative hedge fund is the extreme example, but we see this increasingly in the case of AI and machine learning software. The highest value software product of the future might ingest and process data, and only spit out a key result once a day.\nIn contrast, many marketing products are often used several hours per day by their power users. There are different pathways to creating valuable software, but you need to have a model in mind and commit. Think closely about what your software does and how it will be used as you build it—who are your users, and what is their successful usage model?\nLaw 9: Tone starts at the top\nGreat culture is not about ping pong tables and kombucha on tap. It is about creating a values system so that everyone can perform and can be the best versions of themselves at work. It is also about dedicating resources to support and operationalize systems of fairness, equality, and inclusion so everyone feels like they belong and can play a critical role in making a difference at a company. Every team member is accountable to uphold these values so that teams stay focused, positive, and know how they can impact the organization for the better.\nGreat leaders set the moral compass and define the corporate culture.\nCulture is also a driver in talent recruitment and retention. We increasingly see philanthropy becoming part of the corporate culture, including companies supporting efforts such as Pledge 1%,forming their own .org’s, and running community-oriented team building events.\nWe also suggest that leaders keep a finger on the pulse of employee engagement and do quarterly reports that measure Executive NPS by department, survey employees, and solicit online reviews. We often see the results of these metrics and employee engagement surveys at the board level, and we suggest that the employees that are contributing positively to culture be acknowledged and rewarded.\nLaw 10: Map your fuel stops\nThe most enduring companies raise capital well before they need it, and they plan strategically on when and why they go out for another round.\nExecutive teams take a lot of calculated risks when building a great business, and financing risk should not be one of them, especially in this mature cloud environment in which investors understand and enthusiastically support cloud businesses. If you truly have a business that can lead a massive market (Law 1) and a sales and marketing model that is starting to prove itself (Law 3), it would be irresponsible not to fully invest behind your company’s potential. Otherwise another company in this highly competitive modern market will.\nDevelop a high-level but multi-year financial model early on, and have your financing milestones in mind from the beginning. As you scale up, refine the assumptions and become much more detailed in the model. The most successful cloud CEOs in Bessemer’s portfolio generally raise a half round ahead of what their financial plans say are needed, so that they can always have one to three years of runway in the bank.\nHaving one to three years of runway in the bank allows a company to stay on offense and provide enough buffer to absorb risk and setbacks.\nThis cushion allows companies to be aggressive with growth experiments and also provides a buffer in case some initiatives do not work as well or as quickly as planned. More cash allows cloud businesses to stay on the offense independent of market conditions.\nBonus: Run the \"Public Playbook\"\nMost ambitious cloud founders want to control their own long-term destiny, and ultimately to be a large public company. In the current market environment, crossing $100+ million of ARR, while growing over 40% at cash flow breakeven (or clear line of sight to cash flow breakeven within a year of IPO) generally allows cloud companies to successfully IPO. These businesses have efficiency scores greater than 40%.\nPassing the $100 million ARR threshold is a good proxy for a company having demonstrated its ability to weather competitive pressures, secure product/market fit, and build an efficient sales engine. With current market multiples, it also often implies public valuations of $1+ billion, which is substantial enough that public institutional investors will care about owning a stake in the business.\nIn order to control your own destiny and have the option of a very successful IPO, you should target $100 million+ in ARR and 40% efficiency score.\nStatistically, most cloud founders will choose to sell their businesses before reaching the milestone of an initial public offering, but setting your sights high and having a credible path towards achieving them will also dramatically increase your leverage in M&A discussions when they present themselves. Cloud executives create additional leverage in M&A discussions by forging personal relationships with CEOs of acquisitive companies; often the largest M&A outcomes stem from these relationships.",

    "content": "Article\nHidden Costs of Not Having a Team of A-Players\nFebruary 8, 2022\nOne of the teams I work with was approached about a potential, second-to-none acquisition that came with an impressive leadership team. As we discussed that benefit, my client looked around the room and realized his team was not in the same league. So we had a frank discussion about the serious impact on his company if he made this acquisition. If his team wasn’t all A‑Players.\nHe’s not alone. Most organizations to start with, only have 25% to 30% of A‑players on their team.\nDefining an A‑Player\nPlayers are defined according to their fit with core values and performance or productivity:\n- An A‑Player fits your culture well and delivers consistently excellent results. In school terms, they would get a 90% or higher grade on both. They are creative and efficient, and you love working with them.\n- A B‑Player fits the culture very well but doesn’t consistently get an A grade on the quality of their work or hitting deadlines. They are productively good.\n- A C‑Player doesn’t achieve the expected results and they don’t fit the culture.\nAnd then there are the Toxic As who consistently deliver outstanding results but are a nightmare to work with because they create a lot of drama or friction. They’re often the hardest people to remove, because are so good at what they do and a force to be reckoned with. If they’ve stayed for a long time, they generally have some sort of power, or relationship with the CEO or some other weird dynamic, that has kept them in their role.\nThe costs of not having an all A‑Player team\n1. More work for you\nWhen you work with an A‑Player, there’s not much to do, beyond giving a little guidance.\nBut if people are unable to confidently take on and execute tasks well and on time, you turn into a micro-managing babysitter. You can’t trust that the job is going to get done as expected. You know this is true if you are focused on a lot of short-term, day-to-day stuff.\nWith a Toxic A, you have to manage conflict or drama.\nCaveat: Micro-managing can also be the result of your bad habits and how you lead. When we work with a new company, we try to unpack if the CEO and leaders are involved too much, and if the team has more capability. Often, it’s a little bit of both — a solvable problem if people are coachable into better habits.\n2. Less achievement/results\nA‑Players give you more value for money. A Toxic A- or B‑Player – who likely makes the same salary as an A‑Player yet doesn’t deliver the same results and takes more time to manage – can drain your organization of its strength and ability to achieve.\nYou are also unable to take on new projects. Imagine setting priorities and strategy, at an off-site annual or quarterly workshop, with a team of few or no A‑Players. You have a big new project – say, to implement a new CRM or to expand into a new area – and realize you have no confidence in anyone on the team. As a result, you take on no big projects, or fewer that take longer to achieve. The cost in resources, time and energy is higher and the results, lower. You simply achieve less and squander resources.\n3. More stress for the whole team\nAligned A‑Players, heading in the same direction, generally only create healthy friction. But a B- and C‑Player team who isn’t as capable, or a Toxic A who doesn’t align with your values, are less productive and create misunderstandings which compound. Even one C- or Toxic A‑Player creates more stress and frustration for the team.\nThink of this as a relay race team. If you have one person who can barely run, and can’t pass the baton to somebody else, or who creates drama and problems, the whole team pays a price.\n4. You have to fix more mistakes\nMistakes and messes result from incompetence or mediocrity and relational service and quality issues. And while A‑Players can make mistakes, they generally fix them quickly, without you getting involved.\nHigh performers want to work with high performers.\n5. Leadership becomes undermined\nWhen you don’t deal with a Toxic A or C‑Player, your leadership is undermined as people question why you don’t deal with them. If you keep these players on the team, you endorse their behaviour, and demonstrate that being a toxic jerk is okay in your culture.\n6. B‑Players tend to hire lower Bs or Cs\nIt takes a confident person to hire someone more capable than they are. If someone performs at a 78% level, they’re less likely to hire someone who’ll perform at 110% level.\nIf Bs or Cs on your team are involved in hiring, they’re not going to hire an A. The more Bs you have, the more Bs and Cs you get, and the spiral downward continues.\nIf you drop an A‑Player into a team of Bs, and Cs, three things will happen:\n- That employee will either drop down to the level of the B’s, and C’s, or\n- They will be out quickly, because they want to be in a winning team, or\n- They’ll voice their frustration — and if you don’t fix it, they will leave.\nNo-one wins\nIdentifying and keeping someone who isn’t an A‑Player doesn’t help anyone. Ignoring the situation doesn’t serve your organization and it prevents that person from being an A‑Player at another company where they can be a better fit. Consider that, most of the time, C‑Players or Toxic As just aren’t happy.\nThe Challenge\n- Based on reading this article, you are going to be thinking about a couple of people situations you need to sort out?\n- What are those three situations?\nWant to hear more?

    "content": "Sharpen your strategy document\nClarifying what is and isn’t going to change helps ease the pressure of putting everything in one document.\nStrategy documents have become the pack mules of the business world.\nLike mules, which can carry cargo equaling about 20% of their body weight for more than a dozen miles, strategy statements are often tasked with taking on super-heavy loads. Too many of them now include the mission statement, the purpose statement, a list of enduring cultural values and commitments to various stakeholders, and even the core goals for the business.\nThe information buildup has grown in the last two years as companies are being called on to address many of society’s ills, as they chart a path into the post-pandemic future. This presents a challenge to the vital effort to reduce complexity so that all employees can stay focused on the answers to the company’s most foundational questions: Where are we going? How are we going to get there? How is my work directly contributing to those goals?\nIt’s time to declutter strategy documents. And my suggestion for doing that is to create two lists: what is going to change and what’s not going to change.\nChange management\nLet’s start with what won’t change. Those items shouldn’t be in the strategy document. This category includes all the immutable truths that are part of an organization’s narrative about itself: the purpose and mission statements, its commitment to certain values and priorities, its promises to various stakeholders.\nAny bullet points on the priority list that begin with the words “Continue to…” are obvious candidates for the what-won’t-change list. If, say, attracting and retaining world-class talent has always been a priority, and always will be, it shouldn’t be in the strategy document.\nOnce all those ideas are in their rightful place—on the website or on a slide in a strategy deck, with all the appropriate signaling about their importance—the strategy discussion is freed up to be an actual strategy document.\nIdeally, the new document includes the four elements of a simple and effective framework Dinesh Paliwal, the former CEO of audio entertainment company Harman International Industries, shared with me:\n- a concrete summary statement of the outcome you are trying to achieve\n- the three or four levers you must pull to achieve that goal\n- the headwinds that have to be overcome to achieve that goal\n- a scoreboard for measuring progress.\nA key word in that framework is outcome. I find that this one word can lead to wholesale shifts in strategy discussions, steering them away from priorities, which are more amorphous and often belong in the what’s-not-going-to-change section.\nMission should never be tinkered with. You mess with mission at your own risk,” Sulzberger told me. “Tradition needs to be constantly interrogated.”\nIn the 18 years I spent at the New York Times, I directly observed the importance of separating what is going to change from what’s not going to change. In 2013, A.G. Sulzberger—now the paper’s publisher but at the time an editor there—recruited me to a team that studied how the newsroom could contribute to the transformation the company was trying to pull off in response to the internet’s disruption of its traditional business model.\nWe spent months researching and writing the paper’s “innovation report,” which bluntly described the newsroom’s challenges. They included a siloed culture and an overemphasis on legacy practices that focused on print rather than digital readers.\nAfter the report was published, there was, not surprisingly, a fair amount of worry within the newsroom that all this change would threaten the Times’s long history of maintaining high journalistic standards.\nBut in the internal road-show meetings to discuss the report and answer questions, Sulzberger used the formula posited above—identify what isn’t going to change to help quiet concerns and then focus on what will be transformed. “The most important thing you have to figure out in order to change a company or change the culture of a company is what is not going to change. The reason is that if everything is up for grabs, if you can change literally anything about a company, then the company has no reason for being,” Sulzberger told me when I interviewed him about the key leadership lessons he learned from that time.\n“For an institution to change, it needs to separate mission from tradition,” he added. “Mission should never be tinkered with. You mess with mission at your own risk. Tradition needs to be constantly interrogated.”\nSulzberger used this distinction to help clarify discussions about the impact of transformation on the Times’s culture. But I have found that the simple act of spelling out what is and isn’t going to change is useful in many different contexts, especially in crafting clear strategy documents.\nSo, as you look at your organization’s strategy document, ask yourself whether it makes clear what’s going to change and what’s not going to change. If it doesn’t, it may be time to split it in two and lighten the load for each section.",

    "content": "Building a culture of learning at work\nHow leaders can create the psychological safety for people to constantly rethink what’s possible.\nA few years ago, leaders at the Gates Foundation reached out to see if I could help them improve their culture. They already had a strong culture of performance: They hired world-class scientists and maintained excellence of execution. Their goal was to improve their learning culture, in which people have the humility to know what they don’t know and the curiosity to rethink the way they’ve always done things.\nWhen I first arrived, people were whispering about the annual strategy reviews. It’s the time when program teams across the foundation meet with the cochairs — Bill and Melinda Gates — and the CEO to give progress reports on execution and collect feedback. Leaders were concerned that the pressure to present airtight analyses was discouraging people from taking risks. They often stuck to tried‑and‑true strategies that would make incremental progress rather than daring to undertake bold experiments that might make a bigger dent in some of the world’s most vexing problems.\nThe foundation of a learning culture is psychological safety — being able to take risks without fear of reprisal. Evidence shows that when teams have psychological safety, they’re more willing to acknowledge their own mistakes and figure out how to prevent them moving forward. They’re also more comfortable raising problems and exploring innovative solutions.\nThe standard advice for managers on building psychological safety is to model openness and inclusiveness: Ask for feedback on how you can improve, and people will feel it’s safe to take risks. To test whether that recommendation would work, I had launched an experiment with a doctoral student, Constantinos Coutifaris. In multiple companies, we randomly assigned some managers to ask their teams for constructive criticism. Over the following week, their teams reported higher psychological safety, but as we anticipated, it didn’t last. Some managers who asked for feedback didn’t like what they heard and got defensive. Others found the feedback useless or felt helpless to act on it, which discouraged them from continuing to seek feedback and their teams from continuing to offer it.\nAnother group of managers took a different approach, one that had a less immediate impact in the first week but led to sustainable gains in psychological safety a full year later. Instead of asking them to seek feedback, we had randomly assigned those managers to share their past experiences with receiving feedback and their future development goals. We advised them to tell their teams about a time when they benefited from constructive criticism and to identify the areas that they were working to improve now.\nBy admitting some of their imperfections out loud, managers demonstrated that they could take it — and made a public commitment to remain open to feedback. They normalized vulnerability, making their teams more comfortable opening up about their own struggles. Their employees gave more useful feedback, because they knew where their managers were working to grow. That motivated managers to create practices to keep the door open: They started holding “ask me anything” coffee chats, opening weekly one‑on‑one meetings by asking for constructive criticism, and setting up monthly team sessions where everyone shared their development goals and progress.\nCreating psychological safety can’t be an isolated episode or a task to check off on a to‑do list. When discussing their weaknesses, many of the managers in our experiment felt awkward and anxious at first. Many of their team members were surprised by that vulnerability and unsure of how to respond. Some were skeptical: They thought their managers might be fishing for compliments or cherry‑picking comments that made them look good. It was only over time — as managers repeatedly demonstrated humility and curiosity — that the dynamic changed.\nAt the Gates Foundation, I wanted to go a step further. Instead of just having managers open up with their own teams about how they had previously been criticized, I wondered what would happen if senior leaders shared their experiences across the entire organization. It dawned on me that I had a memorable way to make that happen.\nA few years earlier, our MBA students at Wharton had decided to create a video for their annual comedy show. It was inspired by Mean Tweets, the late‑night segment on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in which celebrities read cruel tweets about themselves out loud. Our version was Mean Reviews, where faculty members would read harsh comments from student course evaluations. “This is possibly the worst class I’ve ever taken in my life,” one professor read, looking defeated before saying, “Fair enough.” One of my own was “You remind me of a Muppet.”\nI made it a habit to show that video in class every fall, and afterward the floodgates would open. Students seemed to be more comfortable sharing their criticisms and suggestions for improvement after seeing that, although I take my work seriously, I don’t take myself too seriously. I sent the video to Melinda Gates, asking whether she thought something similar might help with psychological safety in her organization. She not only said yes; she challenged the entire executive leadership team to participate and volunteered to be the first to take the hot seat. Her team compiled criticisms from staff surveys, printed them on note cards, and had her react in real time in front of a camera. She read one employee’s complaint that she was like Mary F***ing Poppins — the first time anyone could remember hearing Melinda curse — and then explained how she was working on making her imperfections more visible.\nTo test the impact of her presentation, we randomly assigned one group of employees to watch Melinda engage with the tough comments, a second to watch a video of her talking about the culture she wanted to create in more general terms, and a third to serve as a pure control group. The first group came away with the strongest growth mindsets — they were inspired to recognize their shortcomings and work to overcome them.\nBut mindsets aren’t enough to transform a culture. Although psychological safety erases the fear of challenging authority, it doesn’t necessarily motivate us to question authority in the first place. To build a learning culture, we also need to create a specific kind of accountability — one that leads people to think again about their decisions.\nTo build a learning culture, we need to create a specific kind of accountability — one that leads people to think again about their decisions.\nIn performance cultures, people are held accountable for results: Did their projects succeed or fail? But social scientists find that focusing only on outcomes makes it too easy for people to continue with ill‑fated courses of action. It isn’t until a high‑stakes decision goes horribly wrong that people pause to reexamine their practices. Focusing on results might be good for short‑term performance, but it can be an obstacle to long‑term learning.\nIn learning cultures, people don’t stop keeping score. They expand the scorecard to hold others accountable for processes as well as outcomes. Even if the outcome of a decision is positive, it doesn’t necessarily qualify as a success. If the process was shallow, you were lucky. If the decision process was deep, you can count it as an improvement: You’ve discovered a better practice. If the outcome is negative, it’s a failure only if the decision process was shallow. If the result was negative but you evaluated the decision thoroughly, you’ve run a smart experiment.\nThe ideal time to run those experiments is when decisions are relatively inconsequential or reversible. In too many organizations, leaders look for guarantees that the results will be favorable before testing or investing in something new. It’s the equivalent of telling Gutenberg you’d only bankroll his printing press once he had a long line of satisfied customers — or announcing to a group of HIV researchers that you’d only fund their clinical trials after their treatments worked.\nRequiring proof is an enemy of progress. This is why companies like Amazon use a principle of disagree and commit. As Jeff Bezos explained it in an annual shareholder letter, instead of demanding convincing results, experiments start with asking people to make bets. “Look, I know we disagree on this, but will you gamble with me on it?” The goal in a learning culture is to welcome these kinds of experiments, to make rethinking so familiar that it becomes routine and people don’t hesitate to pitch new ideas.\nIn performance cultures, people often become attached to best practices. The risk is that once we’ve declared a routine the best, it becomes frozen in time. We preach about its virtues and stop questioning its vices, no longer curious about where it’s imperfect and where it could improve. Organizational learning should be an ongoing activity, but best practices imply it has reached an end point. We might be better off searching for better practices.\nThat’s what we were after at the Gates Foundation. When Melinda and her colleagues shared their mean reviews, some of the power distance evaporated. Afterward, employees weren’t afraid to dish it out — they knew their leaders could take it. People were less afraid to be vulnerable and more likely to reach out to senior leaders with both problems and solutions. In performance cultures, people are determined to prove themselves. But in learning cultures, people are more interested in improving themselves — and the organization around them.\nAuthor profile:\n- Adam Grant is an organizational psychologist at the Wharton School, the host of the TED podcast WorkLife, and the author of Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don’t Know.\n- Excerpted from Think Again, by Adam Grant, published on February 2, 2021, by Viking, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC.

    "content": "Article\n7 Common Strategy Mistakes\nJanuary 17, 2022\nVery few people really understand and are good at strategy.\nThey confuse it with things like execution or marketing or setting goals.\nThat’s why we recommend the Illustrated Guide to Michael Porter written by Joan Magretta (conceived by Henrik Zimmermann and illustrated by Emile Holmewood). This is a powerful tool anyone can use as a filter to evaluate their own strategy and to help avoid critical strategy mistakes.\nPorter, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of 19 books, is one of the world’s most influential thinkers on management and competitiveness.\nAccording to Porter, these are the seven most common strategy mistakes people make:\n1. Competing to be the best\nYou don’t want to be just a better version of what someone else is doing. Your job is to build a unique and valuable position in the market in a way your customer cares about. Think Tesla.\n2. Substituting execution for strategy\nOf course, you need great execution to make a profit, but if you only look through an execution lens, you’ll lose your strategic advantage.\n“Execution is doing what we already do better.\nStrategy is doing better or different things in the eyes of the customer.”\n3. Confusing marketing with strategy\nMarketing is critical, to find a way to better tell a story and match it with the needs of your customers. But it doesn’t consider the tailored value chain, or the inputs, or how to alter the inputs to provide difference within the market. And while brand is important, it’s not everything. Strategy always comes first.\n4. Chasing the wrong goals\nThe right strategy isn’t chasing the latest fad or your competitors. The job of a business and the number one measure of a CEO is return on capital. Being crystal clear on the stuff that matters most requires a lot of debate and analysis – and it can take time.\n5. Overestimating your strengths\nWhat are your core competencies? Hint: It’s not your name, how long you’ve been in the market or your CRM. A real strength is something your company can do better than any of your rivals.\nYou must have differentiation to be sustainable, to be more appealing to customers and make it easier for salespeople to sell.\n6. Getting the definition of the business wrong\nHave you been looking at your business generically, or have you really zoomed in? Sometimes, you’re not doing what you think you are doing, and you miss the business you are really in.\nPorter’s Five Forces is a great tool to really understand and breakdown the different industry forces acting on your business. Your strengths, activities, core customers and profit can change remarkably when you get this right.\n7. Getting the geographic scope wrong\nExactly where are the edges of your sandbox in which you’re going to play?\nWhether global, national or local, every market has a different scope, customer and value chain. And people can get into trouble when they think that expanding into another market is an extension of what they are already doing. As well as market differences, you’ll cross the boundary of where your competitive advantage stops and you have to be prepared to build it differently.\nOften, starting a simple expansion is like starting a brand new business.\nThe Challenge\nOf the strategic areas highlighted above:\n- Which are you excellent at?\n- Which would help you improve strategy and competitiveness the most if you mastered them?\nFor more about common strategy mistakes, listen to Episode 84 of The Growth Whisperers.\nLawrence & Co’s work focuses on sustainable and enhanced growth for you and your business.

Business leaders can change the game by paying careful attention to seven mission-critical factors.\nA version of this article appeared in the Spring 2022 issue of strategy+business.\nHere’s an agile cautionary tale: a certain US-based bank wanted to be faster on its feet, transform end-to-end customer experiences, and gain an edge over newer, nimbler fintech competitors. So, naturally, it turned to the agile playbook—the set of practices derived from software development to bring multidisciplinary teams together in order to make quick progress on short-term projects. It established daily stand-up meetings and retrospectives—the “ceremonies” of agile. It created agile teams to develop innovative new apps, build better business processes, and craft technology solutions that would support a bevy of new digital offerings. But company leaders soon realized they had a big problem on their hands.\nAlthough the bank was using agile techniques to make some progress, it wasn’t becoming more agile as an organization. It was planting a lot of agile trees that weren’t growing into an agile forest. In technical terms, it wasn’t achieving what we call enterprise agility. When companies scale agile effectively across the enterprise, they gain the capability to adapt to everything the market throws at them. In doing so, they remain competitive and fiscally sound, no matter the scenario.\nWe have seen this situation play out time and time again. Earnest intent, significant investment, and yet no real agility is gained. Agile trees but no agile forests. Despite the embrace of agile methods to transform businesses, catalyze innovation, and accelerate profitable growth, we see companies barely realizing agile’s vast potential. In Six dimensions of the agile enterprise, a 2020 survey of 850 senior executives conducted by Strategy&, PwC’s strategy consulting business, respondents from only a third of the organizations that adopted agile methods said they were successful at creating enterprise agility. Not surprisingly, many of these companies are established organizations built around static, siloed, and structural hierarchies.\nThough these trend lines are concerning, we see a clear path for successful agile transformations. In our work analyzing and advising companies undertaking agile transformations, we’ve identified seven mission-critical factors for closing the agile achievement gap. In what follows, we look at how organizations have overcome hurdles to reimagine their enterprise around customer journeys, product excellence, and innovation, and have achieved true agility in the face of immense global challenges.\nThe difference between agile and agility\nThe agile methodology was created 20 years ago by a group of software developers on a retreat at a ski lodge in Utah. It is now used by organizations throughout the world as the preferred tool for product development, especially software-driven offerings.\nAgile teams work to create innovative solutions to problems. The agile philosophy values (1) individuals and interactions over processes and tools, (2) working software over comprehensive documentation, (3) customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and (4) response to change over plan-following.\nWhen implemented properly, agile methods can turn an organization into an agile enterprise—one that is truly adaptive across the board.\nAgile has become a management buzzword of the digital era, a panacea for every possible challenge facing businesses today, whether it is digital disruption or modernizing the workforce. Often, when leaders speak of agility, they’re not talking about enterprise agility at all; they’re using the word in its standard meaning: fast and nimble. To wit: an organization can be agile in a strict definitional sense without ever adopting an agile approach, just as the same organization can have armies of agile teams and not ever achieve enterprise agility.\n1. Listen to your customers—and the function that advocates for them\nYour product management function guides every step of a product’s life cycle—from development to positioning to pricing—by putting the customer first and ensuring that finished products meet and exceed customer expectations (e.g., a new e-commerce app gets greater engagement than expected). Although most organizations understand the importance of being customer-centric, many companies struggle to grow their product management function within a broader agile transformation.\nOne reason for this is talent management. The high-performing companies we’ve studied as part of our research create clear roles and skills matrices for their product managers (PMs) and product owners (POs) and offer hands-on coaching and opportunities for advancement. The result is greater retention and acquisition of talent.\nWhen a leading US-based insurance carrier focused on nurturing its product management function, it trained and deployed highly skilled PMs and POs as part of its agile program. The PMs and POs, leaning on their unique expertise, created multidisciplinary teams to launch a minimum viable product approach for providing insurance quotes and processing claims. (A minimum viable product is one that’s introduced to the market with the most basic features but is still usable by consumers.) In the end, the insurance carrier was able to launch six products in six months instead of the average 18 months it would have taken before.\n2. Tie your teams—and their daily work—to broader business objectives\nIn agile, an initiative’s success hinges on the composition and ethos of high-performing teams and their ability to deliver in compressed time frames. Yet we’ve observed that organizations often overlook how the work of agile teams is tied to the overall objectives and strategy of the business.\nAt a top US consumer products company, teams were conducting agile ceremonies such as daily stand-up meetings, retrospectives, demos, and team-level planning. However, after a couple of work sprints, several questions remained unanswered: what was the overall solution road map? And how was the teams’ work making an impact at the program and portfolio level of the company?\nTo connect the dots, the company’s digital transformation office incorporated a design thinking approach with the goal of producing interactive program-level training for both business and IT team members. The organization also applied a ten-week, incremental program-level planning process. This approach enabled the company to break down silos between the business and IT units, improve transparency into how tasks were executed, and increase the frequency of feedback loops with an eye toward continuous improvement of processes. The result: the teams came away with a clearer understanding of how their work was driving broader business strategy objectives.\n3. Connect strategy to execution through lean portfolio management\nThe primary role of the lean portfolio management (LPM) function in agile-minded organizations is to align agile development with business strategy. In most cases, this function is made up of staff from the organization’s finance, IT, and business units, and also draws on expertise and input from human resources and IT teams. Most important, the LPM function aligns the annual planning and funding processes with the agile methodology. It also establishes objectives and key results and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of the work being done and to keep deliverables on track. These tasks are often time-consuming and involve large change management efforts, which is why the LPM function must be implemented early in the process.\nA wholesale retail company set out to define and implement an LPM function at the start of its agile transformation. The company needed to modernize its workforce and IT operating model and employ a product-centric mindset on projects. But the work-intake process it had been using suffered from long lead times and delayed approvals, and in some cases pet projects were being prioritized over more strategically aligned initiatives. The company’s portfolio management office created a new intake and demand process that was both agile and product-centric, and defined the roles, responsibilities, and governance forums for the LPM function. The new process was vetted in one division, and the lessons learned were rolled out across other divisions. One result was more transparency into the company’s processes, which allowed management to make better informed decisions about projects. Another result was improved reporting metrics.\n4. Prioritize talent development in your agile transformation\nIt’s easy to focus on business and IT and overlook the vital role that human resources (HR) plays in an agile transformation. Agile hinges on people being empowered and autonomous, and that requires HR to build the systems necessary to ensure the program’s success. We’ve observed that in many agile transformations, HR tends to get involved only as a formality to approve role definitions. But because your people will determine the success of any initiative, HR should have a permanent seat within the agile transformation office (ATO), helping drive the organization’s change agenda from the beginning. HR should work closely with the business and IT leaders to publish clear career paths for agile roles and provide continual learning, coaching, and certification so employees can be as productive and engaged as possible.\nAgile hinges on people being empowered and autonomous, and that requires human resources to build the systems necessary to ensure the program’s success.\nIn one example from our research, a top-ten global industrial IOT software manufacturer worked collaboratively with HR from the beginning of its enterprise transition to agile. HR helped the company define and expand product management roles and bring personnel together into newly created communities of practice for key agile roles, which enabled better partnerships between leaders in business and IT units. The company’s HR learning and development team coordinated with its agile center of excellence to develop training on a common language and a common understanding of agile for all 250,000 employees. HR also provided input from exit surveys to influence the design of agile ways of working, which included focusing on in-person social activities. One outcome was increased employee satisfaction and an 11% year-over-year improvement in employee retention.\n5. Give your agile transformation office some teeth\nEmpowering the agile transformation office with actionable mandates and support from the C-suite sends a clear message to the organization that senior leaders are invested in agile as a value differentiator and not a mere management fad.\nIn our experience, the ATOs that are given the lowest investment and lightest touch from the C-suite tend to establish generic training and focus merely on educating the enterprise about agile. Conversely, the ATOs that get the most investment and buy-in from senior leadership tend to be cross-functional and dynamic. They’re likely to be made up of business and IT personnel, along with representatives from HR, finance, corporate communications, and change management. They create standards and playbooks, provide hands-on coaching, partner with the business teams for change management programs, and take an active role in collecting data and key metrics on the agile transformation.\nOne international insurer decided to keep its ATO focused on establishing a common way of working, customizing training programs, and maintaining a collaborative working space for agile teams. Agile remains largely optional at this company, with some lines of business employing agile concepts more intentionally than others.\nA second company, a US-based insurer, chose to invest more deliberately in its ATO, empowering the office to design and implement the agile operating model across all lines of business; develop role-specific and company-specific training; provide hands-on coaching to the teams; deploy delivery metrics and dashboards across the enterprise; and roll out tools to support agile execution, finance management, and business portfolio governance. As a result, the company achieved enterprise agility. Even though the company is only about 60 to 70% through its agile transformation, it’s already seeing shorter delivery times and faster speed-to-market.\n6. Take an end-to-end approach to performance measurement\nHow does a company know if an agile transformation is working? That’s a complicated question. It takes time for an agile transformation to drive cost reduction or revenue growth. And even when a company sees new cost efficiencies or an uptick in sales, it can be devilishly difficult to attribute any success directly to agile.\nThat’s why agile transformation offices tend to create metrics such as “business units touched” or “number of employees trained.” In doing so, they sometimes struggle to measure and articulate the real business impact. In our experience, the most successful ATOs incorporate three types of metrics from an early stage and take an end-to-end approach to tracking performance. In the beginning, transformation progress metrics (such as agile penetration into the organization; the number of businesses, teams, and personnel covered; the number of employees trained; and the number of people certified in agile) provide indicators of how well the agile transformation is progressing. As teams start to operate in agile rhythms, execution metrics (such as velocity, cycle time, volatility, and defect rate) become more important. Once products go live, business-value metrics (such as revenue, core earnings, cost, and Net Promoter Score) tell a story of the overall business impact.\nWith these measurements, the key for leaders is to recognize any early indicators of a problem that needs to be fixed.\nAt one US-based regional consumer bank, ATO leaders were struggling to grasp how agile transformation activities were contributing to business outcomes. So the office decided to define a new set of KPIs. These KPIs included the number of agile teams that were operational, the number of production releases per month for core platforms, and the number of defects per month. The company baselined the KPIs and set a 12-month target, tracking the metrics month over month to identify areas that needed improvement. There were a few metrics that the team couldn’t assign targets to in the beginning, but they tracked those metrics anyway and, after they were better understood, identified targets. This helped the ATO make a case for continued investment by showing the progress it had made in several areas, such as application availability, the number of releases per month for core platforms, and the number of teams using a new continuous-integration and continuous-delivery pipeline.\n7. Find your agile stars and let them lead the journey\nMany organizations undertake agile transformations with set timelines and predetermined expectations of ROI. Yet they fail to account for the massive change that agile requires of the organization. Employees must make huge shifts in how they work, prioritizing collaboration over individual outcomes and activities, thinking in increments, and becoming more comfortable with rapid experimentation and failing fast. To effectuate this kind of change, top management needs to be active and involved in elevating its agile stars and bridging divides between business functions and units.\nAt a UK-based global media holding company, the new CIO used an agile transformation to change the ethos of IT from “order-taker” and “break-fixer” to that of a partner with a permanent seat at the decision-making table. The company’s executives and senior management embraced the need for transformation, and identified a group of 25 “game changers” to carry out critical work over an eight-week period. That team went through rigorous applied learning, coaching, and community-based activities. The group was then expanded to 75, with the original 25 taking on deeper coaching and teaching roles. The outreach was scaled and eventually touched the whole target population, and employees reported a 15% increase in employee engagement and readiness for transformation, a 22% increase in employee satisfaction, and a 42% increase in the commitment to new ways of working.\nAdopting agile, gaining agility\nWhat started 20 years ago as a tool for software development has become a leading management method for transforming business models to fit changing requirements. When companies master agile methods and scale them across the enterprise, they can accelerate innovation in order to remain market-relevant and fiscally sound. But as we’ve seen in helping companies manage their agile transformations, pitfalls abound. Often, organizations spend so much time and energy setting up their agile transformation program that they lose sight of organizational challenges such as breaking down silos between the business and IT functions or devising the right KPIs. By the time they reach the execution stage, it can be too late—and that’s where the problems emerge. But the pressure on businesses to transform themselves to drive greater productivity, speed, customer engagement, and employee retention has never been greater.\nAlthough we strongly believe that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to agile, having a starting point informed by the success factors of many who have been there before can give you a decisive edge.\nAuthor profiles:\n- Gagan Prakash is an advisor with Strategy&, PwC’s strategy consulting business, specializing in strategic and operational topics, including operational efficiency and effectiveness and enterprise agility.

But the start of a new year can give you the space to integrate valuable practices into your leadership toolbelt to be a more effective, strategic leader through the new year.\nWe’re not going to bore you but rather provide some of our favorite leadership tidbits we know make a difference in organizations. These 8 practical tips don’t come from us – instead, they come from our observations of influential leaders in organizations around the globe. We aren’t the creators of these ideas, but we are the purveyors here to explain how they can change the trajectory of your business.\nPS – Don’t forget to download the free tip sheet to go!\nTip #1 – Start the Year with an Aligned Purpose & Bold Direction.\nCreating focus and inspiring your team starts with creating clear direction. You need a vision statement with grit and purpose.\nVisioning is all about creating the future. Sure, it’s the core foundation of any great strategic plan. But it’s also important because, very simply, you cannot be a great leader without a vision, destination, or future that is genuinely compelling.\nIt’s no easy walk in the park – developing a vision is a challenging process often riddled with anxiety. Check out our video below on how to create a vision statement. You can also check out our visioning guide here.\nGet the Free Visioning Guide Here\nTip #2 – Connect Your Team to What You’re Setting Out to Achieve.\nAsk everyone to set 2-3 OKR stacks directly connected to your goals.\nGetting your team connected – and keeping them connected – to your bigger purpose and annual focus is critical to achieving your vision of success. We love the OKR approach because it wraps the best practices of aligned SMART goal setting in a format that requires your team to review and adapt with quarterly reviews.\nThe power of cascading responsibility through an organization is that your team connects their daily work to your bold direction and purpose. Plus, everyone knows what is expected of them.\nHere is a quick overview on how to create OKRs. Plus, download the free guide for setting OKRs that work in your organization.\nTip #3 – Determine How & Where You’ll Grow.\nEvery organization needs a growth strategy. Vision statements and OKRs are not a growth strategy.\nCreating intentional growth requires a calculated growth strategy. Especially in today’s world, great leaders shift from opportunistic growth, meaning you react to what comes your way, to deliberate growth, building the business you want.\nGood growth strategies define where you play, how you win, how you’ll grow, and what are your growth enablers. You can check out the recap on a great growth strategy in our video below and download our free growth strategy guide to build your own.\nGet the Free Growth Strategy Guide Here\nTip #4 – Establish a Handful of KPIs Critical to Your Success.\nCommit to using quantitative data to drive your decision-making and align around those metrics that tell you if you are winning or losing.\nWe recommend using KPIs as your business health metrics. Much like vital signs, they’re used to measure your business’s health at any given moment.\nWith the pace the world moves today, leaders need to have a regular view of indicators to measure the health and vitality of their organizations.\nWe recommend identifying a set of KPIs that measure quantitative, relevant data core to your business. A clear set of metrics tells you if your business is healthy or getting sick. It clarifies what you must focus on right now.\nA good rule to follow is to use 5-7 quantitative measures as KPI health metrics. Learn more about KPIs and health metrics in the video below and our weekly health metrics guide.\nGet the Free Health Metrics Guide Here\nTip #5 – Clarify High Priority, Must Win Battles Every Quarter.\nDeciding what you won’t do is as important as deciding what you will do. Keep them top of mind for your team. Refresh quarterly.\nAs part of our StrategySprintTM approach, we recommend setting focus and high priority battles to win every quarter and keeping them in focus. It sounds simple, but you’d be amazed at how it can keep your team focused on what’s most important right now.\nPro Tip –\nPut the quarterly focus on something visible in your digital or physical workspace. For example, leave your focus at the top of your agendas, on your whiteboard, or wherever it can be a visual reminder.\nTip #6 – Review Organizational Performance Monthly.\nPick a week each month, be consistent, and expect to discuss how to make “reds” into “green.”\nMonthly reviews are purpose-built sessions to review the performance of your OKRs/goals and decide what critical actions you need to take in the next 30 days. As part of your consistent, agile planning cycle, you need to review your performance monthly. It doesn’t need to be a heavy, over-engineered process. But your team should spend 60-90 minutes a month to meet, review performance, and discuss how to take critical actions and course correct.\nTip #7 – Promote Strategic Thinking.\nConduct 2 to 4 strategic conversations next year and build your team’s muscle.\nStrategic conversations help create your future. Period. Any successful organization needs to dedicate time, thought, and effort to dreaming up where you’ll go next. A “strategic” plan becomes an operational plan without a strategy or vision.\nWe want your team to have the pivotal strategic conversations that create your future. So to help you be a great facilitator and leader, we’ve pulled together a handy guide to help you understand what constitutes a great strategic conversation. Plus, we created a list of thought-provoking questions for your team to debate and discuss how to make your organization’s future.\nDownload the Free Strategic Conversations Guide\nTip #8 – Adapt Quarterly.\nBeing agile means lightly refreshing your plan quarterly based on your performance and emerging trends.\nRefreshing your strategic plan annually—or worse, every 3 to 5 years—is so last century. The name of success these days is agility, and if your plan isn’t agile, your success will be harder to come by.\nIf you haven’t already, read up on agile planning with OKRs in our StrategySprintTM Guide. By committing to quarterly refreshes, you’re agreeing to set the next 90 days’ focus based on the previous 90 days’ performance.",

    "content": "Listen to Les McKeown read this blog post:\nIn the 1990s a British anthropologist, Robin Dunbar, put words to something that many growth leaders had viscerally intuited: once a group grows larger than a certain size, social constructs dilute to the point where dysfunctions begin to occur.\nSeveral organizations have used this so-called ‘Dunbar Number‘ as a limit for the size of individual operating units. Gore-Tex, for example, constructed company buildings with room for only 150 people.\nThe Dunbar Number and its real-world effects is something I see fast-growing organizations bumping up against all the time – in fact, it’s one of the major contributing factors to pushing them into the stressful growth stage I call Whitewater.\n\"Once a group grows larger than a certain size, social constructs dilute to the point where dysfunctions begin to occur\". - Les McKeown, Founder and CEO, Predictable Success\nBroaching the Dunbar Number amplifies silo-ization, contributes to the breakdown of cross-functionality and dilutes alignment – three of the clearest symptoms that you’ve left Fun and have indeed fallen into Whitewater.\nHere’s the kicker:\nUnlike in the field of anthropology (Professor Dunbar’s area of study), an organization’s Dunbar Number isn’t so easily narrowed to 150.\nA virtual company’s Dunbar Number, for example, will be much lower (it can be as low as 20 people) than say, a manufacturing company (where 150 is typically pretty accurate) - and a highly Synergistic business will have a higher Dunbar number than say, an Operator-dominant company.\nSo how can you tell you’re reaching your Dunbar number, and what should you do about it when you do?\nHere’s my personal Predictable Success finger-in-the-air test:\nThe first time you see someone walking down the corridor and you can’t remember their name, you’ve entered the Dunbar Zone…and the first time you see someone and can’t recall even hiring them – you’ve hit your number.\nAnd if so, what should you do? Obviously not everyone can simply go find another office building, like Gore-Tex, so here are some other tools you can use:\n1. Amp up the communication.\nStart water cooler sessions, increase the frequency of all-company meetings, start an internal company blog – anything to force non-siloed interactions.\n2. Carve out a ‘commons‘.\nCreate a place or places where your people can mix in a relaxed, non-work environment, both physical and virtual. (The classic ping-pong table is a great start, but in this era of hybrid work environments is not nearly enough.)\n3. Start walking around.\nDon’t just meet with your peers and direct reports – get out into the corridors, offices, cubicle farms, factory floors, Slack channels and Zoom Rooms and talk. Talk. Talk. Engage with your people as people, be open and accessible.\nOne thing is guaranteed: unless you want a dysfunctional, siloed, increasingly ineffective business, once you’re in the Dunbar Zone, inaction is not an option.",

    "title": "A Memo to a New Senior Leadership Team Member",
    "domain": "predictablesuccess.com",
    "age": "1,475 days ago",
    "content": "A version of this article first appeared in Inc.com\nListen to Les McKeown read this blog post:\nKai –\nEarlier today, I invited you to join our senior leadership team.\nAs you know, I and the rest of the team are delighted with the work you've been doing for us as a VP over the last few years, and we feel it is time you joined us as part of our most senior decision-making team.\nThat said, accepting our offer to join the senior leadership team is something I want you to consider carefully. It is not something to accept lightly, or without due consideration.\nAccordingly, I thought it would be helpful to give you some indication of what we expect from you in your capacity as a member of the executive team, and what you can expect from me and your peers if you do decide to join us.\nLet me start with our three governing principles. You’ll need to fully grasp these in order to make sense of what you will see in action at our executive team meetings:\n1. Check Your Hat at the Door.\nAs a member of the executive team, your role is to share in the leadership of our organization. The entire organization. Not just your department.\nIn executive sessions, you’re not there to represent your functional department, you’re there to lead the overall enterprise. You lead your department the rest of the time.\nLook at it this way – in leadership team meetings, you check your functional hat at the door.\n\"As a senior leader, you’re not there to manage your department, you’re there to lead the overall organization. You run your department the rest of the time.\" - Les McKeown, Founder and CEO, Predictable Success\nOf course, you will need to put it back on again when there are specific decisions to be made about which we need your subject matter expertise, or special insights that you can give us because of your functional knowledge, but you’ll find that this is less frequent than you might expect.\nThe consequences of this is that you can expect to see the following in our team meetings:\n- Everyone (including you) is expected to contribute strategically to everything we discuss, not just those matters that fall into your functional ambit. That doesn't mean you're expected to 'chip in' to every discussion, but it does mean that you are expected to be engaged at all times;\n- Everyone (including you) is required to help us reach decisions that are for the better good of the organization as a whole, not just good for you or your team;\n- As a leadership team, you'll notice that we don't react positively to contributions that are either self-serving or defensive regarding the contributor’s specific functional area.\nThis may come across as somewhat schoolmaster-ish, but what I want you to see clearly before accepting the offer to join us, is that adding value as a member of the executive leadership team is dependent upon you moving beyond your proven functional brilliance and working for what is best for the organization overall, even if that occasionally means agreeing to (or even proposing) solutions and initiatives that don't directly positively impact your functional area.\n2. Think Laterally, Not Vertically.\nUntil now, your key relationships in this organization have been vertical: upward to your manager (me), and downward to your direct reports. Once you agree to join the executive team, your key relationships will shift from the vertical to the horizontal.\nAs of then, your first and overriding commitment will be to your peers – the other members of the executive leadership team – not to your functional group.\nWhy? Because as I already mentioned there will, on occasion, be conflicts between what is good for your team and what is good for the organization as a whole.\nWhen those conflicts occur, your commitment must be to the organization – represented by your executive team members – not to your specific functional area.\nNow, this of course does not mean that you can no longer be loyal to your functional group, and (so long as you heed the first point above about being self-serving or defensive) it doesn’t mean that you cannot lobby for their best interests or represent their needs – indeed, we expect you to do just that.\nSo let me repeat, so as to be clear: we don’t expect you to weaken or dilute any of the existing loyalties that you have. Instead, we expect you to add to it another layer of commitment: to the members of the executive leadership team. Think of it as an 'and', not an 'or'.\nThe reason I'm taking the time to emphasize this point is that over the years, I've learned that there are many highly competent, committed functional leads who simply don't want to give up on their primary allegiance being to their functional team - they only really live and breathe happily when fully immersed in their area of technical excellence, surrounded by their team, and are uncomfortable being asked to make or agree to decisions that are not wholly in their own teams' best interests.\nThere's not a darn thing wrong with that mindset, and there is plenty of room for it to thrive in our organization. So if you think this might be you, let's talk a little longer about whether being on the senior leadership team is right for you, or would simply leave you feeling hamstrung and frustrated.\n3. Bring a Dollar Bill.\nWe practice what we call ‘dollar bill management’.\nWhat I mean is this: As you will discover, we necessarily discuss a huge range of issues – often intensely. We each say our piece. We argue hard, sometimes at length. We say what is on our minds (courteously and civilly). We challenge each other and our ideas.\nSometimes it gets heated. But by the time we finish talking, and we proceed to make a decision, the dynamic changes: When a decision is made, we all uphold it, 100%.\nIt's something the Brits call 'cabinet responsibility', and the implications of this are important:\n- Team members don’t second-guess executive team decisions. After our meetings there's no lobbying to pick apart any decision we made.\n- Once they're made, team members don't complain about our decisions - to anyone.\n- When it comes to implementation, team members participate fully - which means no obstructing, ignoring or sandbagging any decisions or their implications or consequences.\nYou do get to be a role model in implementing agreed-upon decisions – swiftly, fully and with enthusiasm, whatever your stance was while the decision was being debated.\nThink about it this way: once the decision has been made, you can't get a dollar bill between us.\nNow, to be clear - this doesn’t mean that we believe the leadership team is infallible (far from it), or that we all have to act like robots and persevere with the consequences of poor decisions.\nThe executive team makes mistakes: sometimes a decision proves to have been the wrong one. When that happens, any executive team member can bring evidence that a decision needs to be re-thought – but only after an agreed period of supportive compliance, and only in a scheduled executive sessions.\nKai, this is probably enough for you to take on board while considering our offer to join the executive team. I'd like to close by assuring you that none of the above is meant to deter you from joining us - as you'll find out, we have a wonderfully strong, collegiate relationship as a team and - thanks mostly to the guiding principles above - our interactions are marked with mutual respect and good humor.\nI look forward to you joining us.",

    "content": "Guest Column: Three Words to Avoid and What to Say Instead\nBy Karen Laos\nThere are many words we use by habit that take away from our credibility. Most of the time we don’t even realize we’re using them.\nWant to see if you do? More importantly, what to say instead?\nHere they are:\n- “I.”\nA few times a week, I endure a rigorous cycling class where all I want is a decent workout. As a communication junkie, what I notice a lot is the use of “I” language.\nWhen we’re giving direction or delivering a message of influence, this is not the time to use “I” language. That is a time to focus on your listeners and what they need. They don’t care about what YOU need.\nAllow me to explain. The instructors will say things like: “I want you to spin faster,” or “I need you to push yourself for one more minute,” or “I want you to think about why you came here today!” And while it’s all said with great enthusiasm—and sometimes to the tune of Beyonce’ or Rihanna in the background—it misses the mark.\nNotice how eliminating the “I” part makes it a much stronger message that has its audience in mind: “Spin faster!” “Push yourself for one more minute!” “Think about why you came here today!” Now we’re talking. It’s about me, making it more relevant and influential, with a much greater chance of inspiring me to do it.\nIt’s also important to avoid “I” language so you come across with more credibility. “I” language softens our message and takes away from the impact you could have.\nAt your next meeting, instead of using phrases like,”I think this will increase our business,” or “I believe this will make a difference to our bottom line,” say, instead: “This will increase our business,” or “This will make a difference” and have supporting benefits and action items to back it up.\nRemember: make it about your audience. You’ll increase your credibility and deliver a powerful message of influence.\n- “But”\nWe’ve all heard of the effectiveness of the “Yes, and…” concept from improv…because it works! Moving an idea forward using “and” instead of “but” is much more collaborative and inviting.\nAs soon as we hear the word, “but” it negates everything that was said before it. It’s a small word with a tremendous amount of negative power. See if you can eliminate this word from your vocabulary.\nHot tip: sometimes replacing “but” with “and” doesn’t always work, but putting a period at the end of the sentence and then starting a new sentence works fabulously.\nFor example, “I know we had talked about a salary increase last year. While we don’t have budget for that, what we will do is.…” instead of “I know we had talked about a salary increase last year, but we don’t have budget for it.”\nWho wants to hear that? As human beings, we want options. We want to know what we CAN do. Focus on that as you move your ideas forward.\n- “Kinda, sorta, maybe”\nThese words are in the same camp because they’re all modifiers and value-diminishers. They make us sound unsure and tentative, the opposite of confident.\nYou’d be surprised at the amount of people who use one or all of these words. They sneak up on you and sometimes we don’t even notice them.\nThink of an economy of words. If every word cost us $20, we’d think about each one with much more intention. You want to be concise and share value in each word. Taking these out will help you do that.\nBONUS tip: Avoid the phrase, “Does that make sense?”\nThere’s nothing like negating your own credibility when you ask if something made sense. When you ask this, it can look as if you weren’t sure yourself if you made sense, and this takes away from your confidence.\nInstead, ask, “How did that land for you?” or “How was that helpful?” or “What questions do you have?” That way, you’ll also get a more robust answer than what a closed-answered question would give you.\nOne other effect of saying this is that it can be perceived by the audience as if they’re not capable of understanding and that could come across as patronizing.\nMost of us aren’t thinking about every word we use. It’s not a big deal if you use some of these words once in a while. The problem is when they become a habit and erode our credibility without us even being aware.\nYou’re familiar with filler words such as “um” and “ah.” There are many other perfectly good words that when overused become like another “um.” Words such as, “like,” “right,” “actually,” and “literally.” Work to avoid these in excess, too.\nThis all rolls up to one main idea: Speak with intention if you want to influence and make a meaningful impact. Use these tips to communicate more effectively and come across with confidence.\nOne action I would recommend to increase your communication effectiveness: Record yourself so you can hear (and see) how you sound. The best way to identify your blind spots is through objective feedback in a video or audio recording.\nMost of my clients initially hate the idea of video, but once they get a taste of how quickly it elevates their communication game, they want more.\nIn the meantime, cheers to avoiding these words and increasing your confidence (and impact) instead.\n© Karen Laos Consulting LLC.\nKaren is a professional speaker with rave reviews from NASA, Google, Netflix and UnitedHealthcare.

    "content": "Many companies beginning their GGOB journey ask, How often should your team Huddle? What does a Huddle look like?\nThose just starting out with the Great Game process often fear that these Huddles will be “too time consuming” or “just another meeting.” The truth is that Huddles, when done well, will actually save you time because they improve communication and the execution of tasks. Here, we've broken down each type of Huddle:\n<<Discover The Game Introductory Virtual Workshop>>\nDepartment/Workgroup Huddles\nLength of time: daily for 7-15 minutes\nHuddles should be held at the department or workgroup level as often as necessary to keep the work on track. Often this is daily. These work Huddles are 7 – 15 minutes in duration and should focus on the day’s activities, updates for that department, and how they can positively affect the Team Scorecard.\nManagement Huddles\nLength of time: weekly for 15-30 minutes\nConduct the Management Pre-Huddle weekly before the main Huddle. This Huddle reviews workgroup performance drivers and will develop a financial opinion from the performance of operations. Continues the communication up through the company.\nMain Huddle\nLength of time: weekly for 30-60 minutes\nIn the Main Huddle, share the financial and Critical Number performance with all employees. This is where the big picture financial outlook is forecast and communication continues across the company.\nIn general, no matter what type of Huddle it is, be sure to create a company-wide Huddle rhythm by conducting Huddles at the same time every day or week so that people know what to expect and can be prepared.\nHow do you Recognize a Successful Huddle?\n- A successful team Huddle starts on time and is fast-paced.\n- The communication revolves around the Critical Numbers of the business and the stories behind the numbers.\n- Communication is forward-looking and to the point highlighting opportunities and emerging issues.\n- Contributions and successes are recognized and celebrated.\n- People freely and candidly share both wins and losses.\n- Questions are encouraged and assumptions are challenged.\n- Learning is emphasized and people leave more informed and educated on the business.\n- People freely commit to helping each other succeed.\n- There is a clear accountability and follow through.\n- People leave with a clean line-of-sight from their decisions and actions and the overall financial performance of the company.\n- People leave fired up and energized.\nTips for Huddling from different locations\n- Can you use a Web-based audio and video meeting?\n- Can you see the attendees all at the same time?\n- and have screen sharing capabilities?\n- Incorporate a live, web-based scoreboard? Can you still share the books and fill out the scoreboard during the meeting so you can enjoy the benefits of “forward forecasting” from the team?\n- Can you record your meeting?\n- Does the software allow for fun?\nLooking to increase employee engagement?

    "content": "Closing the agile achievement gap\nDespite the wide adoption of the agile method across industries and functions, most companies are barely scratching the surface of its vast potential. Business leaders can change the game by paying careful attention to seven mission-critical factors.\nA version of this article appeared in the Spring 2022 issue of strategy+business.\nHere’s an agile cautionary tale: a certain US-based bank wanted to be faster on its feet, transform end-to-end customer experiences, and gain an edge over newer, nimbler fintech competitors. So, naturally, it turned to the agile playbook—the set of practices derived from software development to bring multidisciplinary teams together in order to make quick progress on short-term projects. It established daily stand-up meetings and retrospectives—the “ceremonies” of agile. It created agile teams to develop innovative new apps, build better business processes, and craft technology solutions that would support a bevy of new digital offerings. But company leaders soon realized they had a big problem on their hands.\nAlthough the bank was using agile techniques to make some progress, it wasn’t becoming more agile as an organization. It was planting a lot of agile trees that weren’t growing into an agile forest. In technical terms, it wasn’t achieving what we call enterprise agility. When companies scale agile effectively across the enterprise, they gain the capability to adapt to everything the market throws at them. In doing so, they remain competitive and fiscally sound, no matter the scenario.\nWe have seen this situation play out time and time again. Earnest intent, significant investment, and yet no real agility is gained. Agile trees but no agile forests. Despite the embrace of agile methods to transform businesses, catalyze innovation, and accelerate profitable growth, we see companies barely realizing agile’s vast potential. In Six dimensions of the agile enterprise, a 2020 survey of 850 senior executives conducted by Strategy&, PwC’s strategy consulting business, respondents from only a third of the organizations that adopted agile methods said they were successful at creating enterprise agility. Not surprisingly, many of these companies are established organizations built around static, siloed, and structural hierarchies.\nThough these trend lines are concerning, we see a clear path for successful agile transformations. In our work analyzing and advising companies undertaking agile transformations, we’ve identified seven mission-critical factors for closing the agile achievement gap. In what follows, we look at how organizations have overcome hurdles to reimagine their enterprise around customer journeys, product excellence, and innovation, and have achieved true agility in the face of immense global challenges.\nThe difference between agile and agility\nThe agile methodology was created 20 years ago by a group of software developers on a retreat at a ski lodge in Utah. It is now used by organizations throughout the world as the preferred tool for product development, especially software-driven offerings.\nAgile teams work to create innovative solutions to problems. The agile philosophy values (1) individuals and interactions over processes and tools, (2) working software over comprehensive documentation, (3) customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and (4) response to change over plan-following.\nWhen implemented properly, agile methods can turn an organization into an agile enterprise—one that is truly adaptive across the board.\nAgile has become a management buzzword of the digital era, a panacea for every possible challenge facing businesses today, whether it is digital disruption or modernizing the workforce. Often, when leaders speak of agility, they’re not talking about enterprise agility at all; they’re using the word in its standard meaning: fast and nimble. To wit: an organization can be agile in a strict definitional sense without ever adopting an agile approach, just as the same organization can have armies of agile teams and not ever achieve enterprise agility.\n1. Listen to your customers—and the function that advocates for them\nYour product management function guides every step of a product’s life cycle—from development to positioning to pricing—by putting the customer first and ensuring that finished products meet and exceed customer expectations (e.g., a new e-commerce app gets greater engagement than expected). Although most organizations understand the importance of being customer-centric, many companies struggle to grow their product management function within a broader agile transformation.\nOne reason for this is talent management. The high-performing companies we’ve studied as part of our research create clear roles and skills matrices for their product managers (PMs) and product owners (POs) and offer hands-on coaching and opportunities for advancement. The result is greater retention and acquisition of talent.\nWhen a leading US-based insurance carrier focused on nurturing its product management function, it trained and deployed highly skilled PMs and POs as part of its agile program. The PMs and POs, leaning on their unique expertise, created multidisciplinary teams to launch a minimum viable product approach for providing insurance quotes and processing claims. (A minimum viable product is one that’s introduced to the market with the most basic features but is still usable by consumers.) In the end, the insurance carrier was able to launch six products in six months instead of the average 18 months it would have taken before.\n2. Tie your teams—and their daily work—to broader business objectives\nIn agile, an initiative’s success hinges on the composition and ethos of high-performing teams and their ability to deliver in compressed time frames. Yet we’ve observed that organizations often overlook how the work of agile teams is tied to the overall objectives and strategy of the business.\nAt a top US consumer products company, teams were conducting agile ceremonies such as daily stand-up meetings, retrospectives, demos, and team-level planning. However, after a couple of work sprints, several questions remained unanswered: what was the overall solution road map? And how was the teams’ work making an impact at the program and portfolio level of the company?\nTo connect the dots, the company’s digital transformation office incorporated a design thinking approach with the goal of producing interactive program-level training for both business and IT team members. The organization also applied a ten-week, incremental program-level planning process. This approach enabled the company to break down silos between the business and IT units, improve transparency into how tasks were executed, and increase the frequency of feedback loops with an eye toward continuous improvement of processes. The result: the teams came away with a clearer understanding of how their work was driving broader business strategy objectives.\n3. Connect strategy to execution through lean portfolio management\nThe primary role of the lean portfolio management (LPM) function in agile-minded organizations is to align agile development with business strategy. In most cases, this function is made up of staff from the organization’s finance, IT, and business units, and also draws on expertise and input from human resources and IT teams. Most important, the LPM function aligns the annual planning and funding processes with the agile methodology. It also establishes objectives and key results and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of the work being done and to keep deliverables on track. These tasks are often time-consuming and involve large change management efforts, which is why the LPM function must be implemented early in the process.\nA wholesale retail company set out to define and implement an LPM function at the start of its agile transformation. The company needed to modernize its workforce and IT operating model and employ a product-centric mindset on projects. But the work-intake process it had been using suffered from long lead times and delayed approvals, and in some cases pet projects were being prioritized over more strategically aligned initiatives. The company’s portfolio management office created a new intake and demand process that was both agile and product-centric, and defined the roles, responsibilities, and governance forums for the LPM function. The new process was vetted in one division, and the lessons learned were rolled out across other divisions. One result was more transparency into the company’s processes, which allowed management to make better informed decisions about projects. Another result was improved reporting metrics.\n4. Prioritize talent development in your agile transformation\nIt’s easy to focus on business and IT and overlook the vital role that human resources (HR) plays in an agile transformation. Agile hinges on people being empowered and autonomous, and that requires HR to build the systems necessary to ensure the program’s success. We’ve observed that in many agile transformations, HR tends to get involved only as a formality to approve role definitions. But because your people will determine the success of any initiative, HR should have a permanent seat within the agile transformation office (ATO), helping drive the organization’s change agenda from the beginning. HR should work closely with the business and IT leaders to publish clear career paths for agile roles and provide continual learning, coaching, and certification so employees can be as productive and engaged as possible.\nAgile hinges on people being empowered and autonomous, and that requires human resources to build the systems necessary to ensure the program’s success.\nIn one example from our research, a top-ten global industrial IOT software manufacturer worked collaboratively with HR from the beginning of its enterprise transition to agile. HR helped the company define and expand product management roles and bring personnel together into newly created communities of practice for key agile roles, which enabled better partnerships between leaders in business and IT units. The company’s HR learning and development team coordinated with its agile center of excellence to develop training on a common language and a common understanding of agile for all 250,000 employees. HR also provided input from exit surveys to influence the design of agile ways of working, which included focusing on in-person social activities. One outcome was increased employee satisfaction and an 11% year-over-year improvement in employee retention.\n5. Give your agile transformation office some teeth\nEmpowering the agile transformation office with actionable mandates and support from the C-suite sends a clear message to the organization that senior leaders are invested in agile as a value differentiator and not a mere management fad.\nIn our experience, the ATOs that are given the lowest investment and lightest touch from the C-suite tend to establish generic training and focus merely on educating the enterprise about agile. Conversely, the ATOs that get the most investment and buy-in from senior leadership tend to be cross-functional and dynamic. They’re likely to be made up of business and IT personnel, along with representatives from HR, finance, corporate communications, and change management. They create standards and playbooks, provide hands-on coaching, partner with the business teams for change management programs, and take an active role in collecting data and key metrics on the agile transformation.\nOne international insurer decided to keep its ATO focused on establishing a common way of working, customizing training programs, and maintaining a collaborative working space for agile teams. Agile remains largely optional at this company, with some lines of business employing agile concepts more intentionally than others.\nA second company, a US-based insurer, chose to invest more deliberately in its ATO, empowering the office to design and implement the agile operating model across all lines of business; develop role-specific and company-specific training; provide hands-on coaching to the teams; deploy delivery metrics and dashboards across the enterprise; and roll out tools to support agile execution, finance management, and business portfolio governance. As a result, the company achieved enterprise agility. Even though the company is only about 60 to 70% through its agile transformation, it’s already seeing shorter delivery times and faster speed-to-market.\n6. Take an end-to-end approach to performance measurement\nHow does a company know if an agile transformation is working? That’s a complicated question. It takes time for an agile transformation to drive cost reduction or revenue growth. And even when a company sees new cost efficiencies or an uptick in sales, it can be devilishly difficult to attribute any success directly to agile.\nThat’s why agile transformation offices tend to create metrics such as “business units touched” or “number of employees trained.” In doing so, they sometimes struggle to measure and articulate the real business impact. In our experience, the most successful ATOs incorporate three types of metrics from an early stage and take an end-to-end approach to tracking performance. In the beginning, transformation progress metrics (such as agile penetration into the organization; the number of businesses, teams, and personnel covered; the number of employees trained; and the number of people certified in agile) provide indicators of how well the agile transformation is progressing. As teams start to operate in agile rhythms, execution metrics (such as velocity, cycle time, volatility, and defect rate) become more important. Once products go live, business-value metrics (such as revenue, core earnings, cost, and Net Promoter Score) tell a story of the overall business impact.\nWith these measurements, the key for leaders is to recognize any early indicators of a problem that needs to be fixed.\nAt one US-based regional consumer bank, ATO leaders were struggling to grasp how agile transformation activities were contributing to business outcomes. So the office decided to define a new set of KPIs. These KPIs included the number of agile teams that were operational, the number of production releases per month for core platforms, and the number of defects per month. The company baselined the KPIs and set a 12-month target, tracking the metrics month over month to identify areas that needed improvement. There were a few metrics that the team couldn’t assign targets to in the beginning, but they tracked those metrics anyway and, after they were better understood, identified targets. This helped the ATO make a case for continued investment by showing the progress it had made in several areas, such as application availability, the number of releases per month for core platforms, and the number of teams using a new continuous-integration and continuous-delivery pipeline.\n7. Find your agile stars and let them lead the journey\nMany organizations undertake agile transformations with set timelines and predetermined expectations of ROI. Yet they fail to account for the massive change that agile requires of the organization. Employees must make huge shifts in how they work, prioritizing collaboration over individual outcomes and activities, thinking in increments, and becoming more comfortable with rapid experimentation and failing fast. To effectuate this kind of change, top management needs to be active and involved in elevating its agile stars and bridging divides between business functions and units.\nAt a UK-based global media holding company, the new CIO used an agile transformation to change the ethos of IT from “order-taker” and “break-fixer” to that of a partner with a permanent seat at the decision-making table. The company’s executives and senior management embraced the need for transformation, and identified a group of 25 “game changers” to carry out critical work over an eight-week period. That team went through rigorous applied learning, coaching, and community-based activities. The group was then expanded to 75, with the original 25 taking on deeper coaching and teaching roles. The outreach was scaled and eventually touched the whole target population, and employees reported a 15% increase in employee engagement and readiness for transformation, a 22% increase in employee satisfaction, and a 42% increase in the commitment to new ways of working.\nAdopting agile, gaining agility\nWhat started 20 years ago as a tool for software development has become a leading management method for transforming business models to fit changing requirements. When companies master agile methods and scale them across the enterprise, they can accelerate innovation in order to remain market-relevant and fiscally sound. But as we’ve seen in helping companies manage their agile transformations, pitfalls abound. Often, organizations spend so much time and energy setting up their agile transformation program that they lose sight of organizational challenges such as breaking down silos between the business and IT functions or devising the right KPIs. By the time they reach the execution stage, it can be too late—and that’s where the problems emerge. But the pressure on businesses to transform themselves to drive greater productivity, speed, customer engagement, and employee retention has never been greater.\nAlthough we strongly believe that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to agile, having a starting point informed by the success factors of many who have been there before can give you a decisive edge.\nAuthor profiles:\n- Gagan Prakash is an advisor with Strategy&, PwC’s strategy consulting business, specializing in strategic and operational topics, including operational efficiency and effectiveness and enterprise agility.

    "content": "How to jump-start innovation and organizational change\nShort-burst, virtual collaboration modules can help employees solve problems quickly and creatively.\nA version of this article appeared in the Spring 2022 issue of strategy+business.\nIn the spring of 2020, an Asia-based fintech was blindsided by surging demand for electronic payments. As millions of customers took their transactions online at the outset of the pandemic, many for the first time, the company’s onboarding, troubleshooting, and other service functions struggled to keep up. Around the same time, my own employer, IMD business school, had to quickly migrate its executive education programs online. Creating this new model required an upgrade of our interfaces with program applicants and participants to ensure an intuitive yet high-end experience.\nConfronted with unforeseen, pressing challenges, both organizations responded by hosting short-burst, virtual collaboration modules. The fintech brought together 200 employees for a first-of-its-kind, five-day online program. The objectives were to kick-start innovation and stimulate cultural change by asking engineers to think like product and customer relationship managers. Meanwhile, IMD assembled a group of managers for a virtual workshop sponsored by the chief digital and client experience officer (CDXO). The idea was to examine which aspects of the school’s digital interfaces were outdated, and how they could be enhanced in a way that would simultaneously revamp internal processes and foster the kinds of cross-departmental collaboration that turned out to be vital during COVID-19.\nAs part of these experiments, and similar efforts initiated by organizations around the world during the pandemic, professional silos tumbled down, and traditional hierarchies, structures, and procedures were reimagined. The workforce thrived under pressure and came away energized by new possibilities. This success naturally raises important questions: can organizations mobilize themselves to run short-burst, virtual collaboration modules under “normal” circumstances, and not just during crisis mode? And can their efforts achieve more than addressing a one-off challenge—instead serving as a catalyst of deeper organizational transformation? My research suggests the answers are yes, but only if leaders understand what these efforts are, what they aren’t, and how to design them for optimal efficiency and creativity.\nAgility, not agile\nSeveral similarities exist between short-burst, virtual collaboration modules and agile sprints. Both are processes that thrive on experimentation. Both involve small, cross-disciplinary teams, and provide these teams with a sense of autonomy. Yet the two methods’ thrusts are fundamentally different. Agile sprints, true to their roots in software development, are typically geared toward delivering incremental product improvements, visualizing workloads, and prioritizing activities already in progress. Therefore, they work best with sequential tasks, in an environment where the need for innovation is continuous, and where teams can be assigned end-to-end responsibilities. As a result, agile sprints minimize issues of interdependence. Historically and structurally, they have drawn much of their energy from the face-to-face interactions of co-located teams.\nBy contrast, a short-burst, virtual collaboration module tackles interdependencies head-on. Rather than pursue incremental improvements, it aims to grapple with disruptive problems and challenges. In this approach, digital collaboration platforms are not a work-around but an instrument of choice that combines low cost with global reach. Crucially, adopting new digital tools, dissolving silos (organizational, technological, psychological), and putting employees—even if just for a few hours at a time—through disruptive scenarios in an otherwise safe space will lead to an aggregate effect. It stretches the organization’s rapid adaptation muscle; it empowers people by equipping them to become part of the transformation; and it enables individuals, teams, and the organization to learn how to change.\nDesigning for collaboration\nAlthough online teaming may seem like second nature nearly two years into the pandemic, planning a short-burst, virtual collaboration module requires leaders to follow five steps.\n1. Define the challenge. The first step is to understand the challenge and identify a clear problem that needs to be solved. The problems that lend themselves best to this approach are typically new and complex, and demand fresh solutions.\nIn this context, it is useful to think carefully not only about the challenge but also about its root causes, manifestations, and effects; consider the organization’s previous efforts, if any, at solving related problems; and imagine the desired outcomes. Leaders should hold a problem-definition workshop to zero in on a specific organizational challenge or area of disruption and break it down into concrete components. Attended by the C-suite—and, in some cases, representatives from HR or another function in charge of organizational learning—this workshop is a guided event during which facilitators also help the attendees determine exactly what they will ask the team to accomplish during the module.\nLeaders of the Asia-based fintech, for instance, knew they had to resolve customer pain points amid an unprecedented surge in demand for digital payments. They broke the problem down into specific areas that needed both technical and behavioral solutions, such as identifying bottlenecks, building internal awareness of the company’s shifting priorities, connecting with longer-term goals of building organizational agility, and designing “moments of truth” and other opportunities to delight customers.\nIMD’s interventions in 2020 brought together senior management, with the CDXO acting as the main sponsor. To declare simply, “We need to be more customer-centric!” would have been too broad. The workshop distilled this goal into workable problems, such as, “How can we improve applicants’ online experience in ways that are user-friendly as well as sophisticated?”\n2. Assemble diverse teams. Companies that stick to the old ways and focus on titles, reporting lines, and job descriptions will be unable to unleash a short burst of rapid adaptability. This is a time to be pragmatic and to pool whatever skills and experience may represent a piece of the puzzle. Involving volunteers and drawing on their intrinsic motivation may give the process an extra boost.\nUnleashing a short burst of rapid adaptability won’t happen by focusing on titles, reporting lines, and job descriptions. This is a time to be pragmatic and to pool whatever skills and experience may represent a piece of the puzzle.\nTo help blur the boundaries between the engineering side and the customer-facing side of the company, the fintech brought together product managers, designers, engineers, DevOps specialists, presales experts, technical writers, business and product analysts, product marketers, and customer support staff. The idea here was that this combination of expertise would enable the team to narrow the gap between what needed to be done (from a customer and product perspective) and what could be done quickly (from a software engineering standpoint).\nAt IMD, we similarly aimed for a maximum diversity of experience in innovation. As a result, the staff who signed up to take part in the virtual collaboration came from CRM solutions, IT systems, customer support teams, user interface and interactive design, data quality and analytics, business intelligence, program coordination and training, and information security.\n3. Prepare participants for what to expect. Asking team members to jump into an all-virtual environment, an unfamiliar process, and interactions with people they don’t know is a lot. At the same time, aiming for rapid adaptability means that on Day One of the event, the team needs to hit the ground running. That won’t happen if some team members are wholly unfamiliar with the digital tools they will be using or with the proposed structure and dynamics of their virtual collaboration.\nThe fintech spent the week before the event training and mentoring participants in customer pain points as well as deeper customer issues, pulling engineers out of their coding mindset. In the run-up to the IMD event, we encouraged participants to get tactile with digital collaboration platforms such as Miro. The idea was to make people feel that the tech was selected, and the intervention specifically designed, to empower them. Online registration was another great touch point, during which participants received guidance and instruction materials such as short, on-demand videos.\n4. Run the virtual collaboration event. Thanks to its modular design, the event itself can be tailored to a company’s specific needs. For instance, a large-scale, “the more the merrier” event may span 24 to 48 hours from start to finish. Other events may take the form of 18 hours of collaborative, co-creation efforts spread out over three days (for example, an afternoon, a full day, and a morning) or five afternoons, depending on the organization’s specifications and preferences.\nThe event rolls out in short loops of virtual interaction. Instead of channeling ideas and output through meetings and protocols, those taking part enjoy the freedom to ask open-ended questions, examine, challenge, and remove the underlying assumptions. Inevitably, resistance and pain will arise: some individuals will be reluctant to share their output, and some teams will want to give up or agree to disagree. It is important to sandwich more strenuous activities between informal ones, to defuse these tensions and give people a sense of comfort and ease. This may come in the form of games, yoga sessions, or concerts.\nBoth the fintech and IMD appointed an experienced moderator and facilitators to guide the team members and nudge the discussions and collaborations along, using tools and techniques such as timeboxing (allocating a fixed amount of time to an activity). Facilitators also observed the different teams’ dynamics, making sure that individual team members didn’t hijack or otherwise dominate the discussion and the search for practical solutions.\n5. Evaluate outcomes and recognize effort. The intervention’s deliverables, such as solutions or prototypes, are pitched to the C-suite or a selected jury and evaluated on the basis of predefined criteria. For instance: do the team’s recommendations make us think differently? Does the solution represent an innovative, viable approach to the problem? What are the implementation time lines? What is the recommendation’s potential to drive organizational transformation?\nUpon the module’s completion, the fintech’s senior management chose to operationalize 90% of the ideas its employees had put together during their five-day co-creation effort. The company has since rolled out customer support in vernacular languages, expanded into more cities, and launched new product suites in health insurance and small- and medium-sized-enterprise segments. It has also attracted new rounds of financing from large global players.\nIMD’s jury deliberated for two weeks, eventually selecting one of the prototypes for its new online application redesign. In 2021, the school engaged external IT partners to begin implementing selected aspects of the recommendations. Its online program pages now enable prospective applicants to download information, talk to program advisors, and assess their own profiles. These features have been packaged and streamlined, and the release of additional functionality and design elements has been planned.\nToday, as companies enter new phases of the pandemic, and eventually the post-pandemic world, they need to keep evolving the ways in which they trigger their hidden reservoirs of adaptability. The digital space—fast, efficient, low-cost—is the perfect playground for such experiments.\nWith time, running these collaboration modules repeatedly, progressively applying them to bigger and bolder challenges, and fine-tuning their design, organizations will witness the positive effects this approach has on people, and the power they bring to problem-solving.\nAuthor profile:\n- Louise Muhdi is Affiliate Professor at the International Institute for Management Development (IMD).",

    "content": "Winning is not just a matter of pride, of course. It is also a habit. Unfortunately, losing can get to be a habit as well. When people are in the habit of losing, you won’t see fire in their eyes, only sand. If you want to light the fire, you have to begin by creating wins and celebrating wins— by making a big deal out of little victories and then building on the little victories to achieve bigger victories. It’s a way of putting fun in the workplace— literally. We throw parties and hold celebrations at the drop of a hat. What we’re really doing is creating a team.\nThat is, of course, one of the major purposes behind the Great Game of Business. In the early days, however, we couldn’t set up games around the financial statements, because people didn’t understand them and would have been intimidated by them. So we came up with other games, simple games, games we knew people could win. That way, we could begin to create the habit of winning. Every win would give us something to celebrate and allow us to start fires. Along the way, we learned some lessons about the kind of games and goals that work best:\n1. BUSINESS IS A TEAM SPORT— CHOOSE GAMES THAT BUILD A TEAM.\nYou can set up all kinds of games in a company. Avoid the ones that are divisive. The best games are those that promote teamwork and togetherness, that create a spirit of cooperation.\nThose aren’t hard to find, especially in a company with a lot of problems. Any problem can serve as the basis for a game. In my first few months in Springfield, we started games around safety, housekeeping, shipping, you name it. I’d sit in a room with the other managers, and we’d say, “Okay, here’s a problem. What kind of game can we set up around this one?” To deal with the shipping problem, for example, we bought a huge, gaudy trophy, which we called the “traveling trophy,” and we announced it would be awarded each month to the department with the highest shipments. Later we added delivery as a criterion, because our delivery to customers was so bad. We began measuring housekeeping as well. We’d have inspections. We quantified the results by giving points, say, if the floor was swept clean, or by taking points away if there was stuff on top of the lockers. Then we’d give a plaque to the department with the most points at the end of the month.\nAt the same time as you’re fostering team spirit, you can also be using the games to build credibility. One of the first issues I went after, for example, was safety. I chose it partly because I was really concerned. The plant had such a bad safety record that we had to do something fast. The safety issue also gave me an opportunity to send a strong message throughout the organization that we cared about people. Safety is basic. It’s the first thing that can turn people against you. It can undermine everything else you try to do. We’d be sunk if people started thinking, “They say they care about us, but they’re not concerned whether we get hurt or not.” And if that were true, they’d be right.\nSo I took on each issue, and I made it very personal. I went into staff meetings, out on the shop floor, into the cafeteria. I talked to all three shifts. I looked at people, and I said, “We’re going after safety because I want you to go home to your kids. I don’t want anybody to have the responsibility of knocking on the door of your home and saying, ‘I’m sorry, but your daddy’s not coming home because he died at work.’ ” That really got through to people.\nWe organized a safety committee and set a goal of 100,000 hours without an accident. We put up four-foot-high scorekeeping thermometers all over the place, and we filled them in every two thousand hours we advanced closer to the goal. As the weeks went by, the drama began to build. On the afternoon when we hit the goal, we closed the plant down for a beer bust. We played the theme song from Rocky over the public address system while members of the safety committee marched around, handing out fire extinguishers. There was a parade of forklift trucks decorated in crepe paper. People stood around and cheered.\n2. BE POSITIVE, BUILD CONFIDENCE.\nManagers have a bad habit of focusing on the negative. I’ve seen statistics showing how managers tend to react quickly to anything that goes wrong and overlook everything that goes right. Let’s say you have a hundred people, and one guy is constantly complaining. It’s easy to start thinking morale is bad because of that one guy. He gets you down, and he may lead you to institute policies or make changes that put the other ninety-nine at risk. You may highlight problems that aren’t there. And you may forget to praise the ninety-nine. You may miss a big opportunity to inspire people, to get results that you wouldn’t have dreamed possible.\nThis is a serious weakness. One of a manager’s main responsibilities is to build confidence in an organization. To do that, you have to accentuate the positive. If you accentuate the negative, it eats away at the organization. It becomes a demotivator, and management is all about getting people motivated. A manager who doesn’t motivate isn’t doing his or her job. You can’t motivate if you’re continually focusing on the negative.\nSo it’s important to be positive in the way you set up your games. Take the problem we had with shipping. We were way behind schedule, but we didn’t focus on that— we focused on what we needed to ship. We began by breaking the problem into its elements. We put on the board what we did last year, and how we were doing this year, and we decided what records we needed to achieve. Then we said, “Okay, here’s what we did last year, and here’s a new record we set last month. Now let’s go out and beat it.” We didn’t want people thinking about the weight of the stone or the slope of the hill, but about what it was going to feel like when we won.\nWe made some mistakes. For example, we decided to give out a scarecrow to the department with the lowest housekeeping score. We got an old broom, put some eyes on it, made it as ugly as we could. Then we started handing it out. It didn’t work. People quickly lost interest in the game. They got mad, and that defeated the purpose. When you make people mad, they don’t want to compete, and they quit. Our mistake was we got away from accentuating the positive. So we dropped the scarecrow and just handed out the plaques.\n3. CELEBRATE EVERY WIN.\nRecords are important, no matter how insignificant they may seem, because you can celebrate whenever you break one. Every record represents an opportunity for management to compliment people, to make them feel good, and to build confidence and self-esteem. People may be feeling depressed, bored, or whatever. If you don’t celebrate, you’ve missed the chance to cheer them up.\nYou can also use records to change the mindset of an organization, to get people to take responsibility for themselves. Workers often try to delegate problems up to their managers, especially when the managers are new. It’s human nature. They will dump any problem on you if they think you’ll accept it. And you do accept it for a period of time if you’re still learning. You’re going through your basic training. But eventually you have to figure out how to get the situation under control, and the best way is to get people into the game. Maybe they have a good day and set a production record. That’s an opportunity. Seize on the record, make a big deal out of it, celebrate it. What you’re doing is creating and celebrating wins. Celebrate every win, even the small ones. If you celebrate a small win, people will follow it up with another one, and another, and another. After a while, they don’t even know they’re doing it. They’re taking care of themselves. They’re solving their own problems. They aren’t passing them up to you. They’re having fun. Then the manager’s job becomes making sure the fun goes on.\nOnce the games get going, people stop pushing their problems up to management. If you’re caught up in a game, there’s no time to push problems up. You want to go out and solve the problems by yourself. Otherwise, you’ll get behind, and you won’t win. So the games get people to focus on solving the present problems, which leaves the managers free to think about the future problems — and that’s how a manager stays in control. If you focus on future problems, you eliminate surprises. You deliver consistency. You have a very happy work environment.\n4. IT’S GOT TO BE A GAME.\nYou can go too far in trying to light the fire in people’s eyes. If you do, you’ll find that people stop having fun and start getting scared. Then you have to pull back fast. That happened to me at one point. I decided that each of the managers should have a list of ten accountabilities he’d be expected to meet in the course of the year. They were really specific. I got them down to a gnat’s ass. I made them so specific that they overlapped and conflicted. People had to step on one another’s toes to win. It might have worked out if each manager had done 80 percent of what I asked for. But I had two guys who strived to be the best in every category, and so they walked straight into each other’s territory. They almost killed each other.\nThe mistake I’d made was to think people would look at these accountabilities as guidelines, as opportunities to help the company and help themselves at the same time. That was naïve. In fact, individual evaluations inspire fear in a lot of people. They see an implicit threat in a list of individual performance criteria. The message is: if I don’t do these things as well as I can, I’m not doing my job. They look at the accountabilities as a line in the sand. They say, “Okay, this is the line. Management is telling me what I have to do if I want to keep my job.” That’s pretty scary stuff. I’d just as soon keep that line as invisible as possible.\nSo these two guys got into a confrontation. One of them walked up to the other and said, “Hey, you may be meeting your goal, but I ain’t making mine. If I screw up, I could be out the door. My family could be in jeopardy. I could lose my job.” I heard them arguing. I could see that they took the accountabilities not as ideals to strive for but as minimum standards of performance. I realized my mistake. I took the accountability sheets, went out in the backyard, put them in a metal wastepaper basket, and set them on fire.\nThe point is that it’s got to be a game. I hadn’t realized the fear I was building into the system. When you think about it, the fear came out of being alone. Security comes from being with other people. There’s a lot to be said for knowing that everybody’s in the same boat with you, that you aren’t an island, that you don’t have to do it all on your own.\nI learned two other important lessons from that experience:\n5. GIVE EVERYONE THE SAME SET OF GOALS.\nDon’t send people mixed messages. Let them all have the same objectives, and make sure they have to work together to achieve them. Turn success into a group effort. That way, they can win together.\n6. DON’T USE GOALS TO TELL PEOPLE EVERYTHING YOU WANT THEM TO DO.\nToo many goals are useless. You should only have two or, at most, three goals over the course of a year. What’s important is to make sure each goal encompasses five or six things. In other words, choose a goal that people can only meet if they do five or six things right. It goes back to the lesson I learned at Melrose Park when we had the deadline on the Russian tractors: you don’t have to tell people to get the parts in on time if you can get them to concentrate on getting the tractors out.\nAs we’ll see later, it’s a lot easier to come up with those all-encompassing goals when people understand the numbers, and you can give them financial targets to shoot for. But, in any situation, there are usually one or two issues that affect a whole series of problems facing the company, the plant, or the organization. If you can identify those issues, you can use them as levers to affect several things at once.\nBad housekeeping, for example, is frequently a sign of trouble in factories, just as it is in office buildings or homes. Whenever I see too much stock on the shop floor, I know there are production problems. Excess stock creates uncertainty— people never know what to work on next. It also hurts morale by making the work environment messy, cluttered, cramped. But, by the same token, you can use the stock problem as a lever to turn things around. Figure out how much work you have to do each day to get to the point where you have just one day’s stock out on the floor. Then put up a chart and set up a game. That takes care morale, motivation, work space, housekeeping, everything. At the same time, you take the indecisiveness out of the shop floor. People will work on what’s there. They won’t allow problems to accumulate. They’ll know how to schedule their labor. As a result, there will be a continuous flow to the production line because now there’s a limited amount of stock— they have to make every piece count. Volume will pick up.\nWitness The Great Game of Business in action at our next event!\nMore Articles You Might Like:",

    "content": "In our last blog, Define Employee Behavior to Build Your Culture, we shared how driving culture is a teaching function. It’s not simply posting your vision and mission. You and your leadership team teach your people day after day after day, not by what you say, but how you act.\nAbsent an intentional force on your part, your company culture is created, mostly influenced by those with the strongest personalities.\nIn Culture by Design: How to Build a High-Performing Culture, Even in the New Remote Work Environment David Friedman calls his system an “operating system” for culture. It’s intended to get culture so deeply ingrained in the of the organization you can see it in every member of your team. It becomes their DNA. Your culture is pervasive in a way it’s not dependent on just one person.\nHere are Friedman’s 8 step system:\nStep 1: DEFINE the employee behaviors (Freidman calls these Fundamentals) that drive your success\nTo create and drive your culture you must describe it with clarity. What exactly do you want your culture to be. Few organizations can say what their culture is.\nIf you don’t know what you’re teaching, because you’ve not defined it clearly, you’re not to be able to do it effectively, and certainly not consistently.\nIf driving culture is mostly a teaching function, then define exactly what you want your people to learn and build a curriculum around it. You’ll ensure everyone learns the same thing, ultimately, you’ll see greater organizational consistency.\nDefine our culture in absolute terms. Then build a curriculum around it so everyone teaches and learns the same thing.\nStep 2: RITUALIZE the practice of your Fundamentals\nCreating “rituals” is one of the simplest, and yet most powerful, concepts. It’s the key to making things last.\nMany new programs or initiatives have started at work and in our personal lives, only to see them fall by the wayside as we got busy with “real life”? These failures lead to cynicism in our workforce. Your people see every new initiative as the “flavor of the month.” They refuse to engage because they know it will soon be forgotten and/or replaced with a different initiative.\nRituals enable us to stick with things when we wouldn’t normally have the discipline or the motivation to do so on our own.\nStep 3: SELECT people who are the right fit for your culture\nTo build a truly high-performing culture, choose people fit for your culture. People are who they are.\nStart with people who fit in your culture. Taking people who aren’t a good fit hoping you can transform them, reduces the probability of success. We recommend Topgrading.\nStep 4: INTEGRATE new hires into your culture\nFreidman calls the process “orientation” or “on-boarding,” Integration. It’s the process get your new hires up and running in our organization.\n“Integration” provides a different connotation than “orientation.” Orientation suggests you tell them about you. You orient them to you. Integration implies your new team member becomes one of us.\nA person’s first week on the job is the most important week in their entire career. It’s that impactful.\nThe first week sets the tone for everything to follow. It’s the new person’s first impression, and those early impressions tend to be lasting and difficult to change. Few companies spend appropriate time and resources orchestrating every aspect of a new hire’s early experience. Companies spend huge amounts of time, energy, and money on recruiting. Few provide detailed attention on how the new person starts.\nStep 5: COMMUNICATE your culture throughout the organization\nThe more people see and hear about your culture, the more they think about it, the more it becomes part of their everyday experience. Visible reminders are important.\nMany companies post inspirational quotes or images on their walls. Unfortunately, these are not their real culture. When your culture is authentic, the more images and reminders of it, the better.\nStep 6: COACH to reinforce your culture\nYour culture is the actual behavior of your people. The best way to know your culture is to observe your people and how they operate.\nFriedman notes, “How your leaders provide their teams with coaching and guidance on how to resolve issues, as well as feedback on what was done, are critical opportunities to teach and reinforce your culture. Every time you use the specific language and vocabulary of your culture in a coaching session, you remove culture from your walls and make it relevant and meaningful. You show your words on the wall are real, rather than just being signage.”\nStep 7: LEAD your culture by example\nWhat YOU do speaks more loudly than what YOU say. Your people constantly looking at you, consciously and unconsciously. They take their cues from YOU about what’s important. How you handle a difficult customer call, or a thorny ethical question tells them how you respect your culture.\nPeople learn from you every single day. They learn from what you do and from what you don’t do.\nStep 8: DRIVE your culture through accountability\nBe accountable specifically for your culture. How do you show your people and the world you’re serious about this? If there’s no accountability for it, it’s just a wish. See the blogs on Propeller and Accelerate Change by Getting Accountability Right.\nThere are many ways to show your seriousness. Annual surveys on your performance in living to your culture, include elements of your culture in your performance reviews, to replace people who aren’t a fit for our culture.\nTo create an environment where everyone is inspired to give their best, contact Positioning Systems today to schedule a free exploratory meeting.\nGrowth demands Strategic Discipline.\nBuilding an enduring great organization requires disciplined people, disciplined thought, disciplined action, superior results, producing a distinctive impact in the world.\nDiscipline sustains momentum, over a long period of time, laying the foundations for lasting endurance.\nA winning habit starts with 3 Strategic Disciplines: Priority, Metrics, and Meeting Rhythms.

    "content": "For nearly four decades, SRC Holdings have been evangelizing the importance of tapping into the universal human need to win. The Great Game of Business® educates your people in the rules of business, rallies them around a common goal, empowers them to see and improve the score, and engages them by allowing them to share in the rewards— What we call a Stake in the Outcome®—presenting them with the opportunity to win as a team.\nIf you want to see success the way SRC has for almost four decades, you must start with communication. You need a system to ensure that you get the most out of your meetings. That doesn’t mean you need one identical to SRC’s meetings, or Huddles as we call them. On the contrary, your system will inevitably look, sound, and feel very different, as well it should. Companies are as diverse as people, and nothing is more distinctive than how you communicate. You have to develop a language and style with which you and your people feel comfortable, which fits your business personality. You will also have to adapt other companies’ techniques to your circumstances, and you may well have to invent new methods of your own.\nThe truth is that every business will face unique challenges in developing an effective communications process. If you need help overcoming them, our advice is to explain the problem to your people and ask them for their ideas. Beyond that, let us offer some lessons that our founder, Jack Stack, has learned over the years and that you may find helpful as well.\nKeep It Regular and On Time\nThe most important thing about a weekly meeting is that everybody knows it begins at 9:00 every Wednesday morning. It’s not 10:30 on Tuesday this week, 3:00 on Wednesday next week, then back to 9:00 after that. It’s always the same day, same time, same place. That way, people can count on it, plan for it, and develop a routine around it. They don’t have to spend a moment thinking about where or when the meeting will take place. They can focus all their attention on The Game.\nHold It Frequently Enough to Stay in Control of the Numbers\nOver the years, SRC has experimented with the frequency of the Huddle cycle. For us, the weekly staff meeting is key to our communication style; two weeks was too long between updates, which disrupted the routine for the team. Maybe every two weeks is the perfect Huddle cycle, or bi-weekly fits your needs more due to your circumstances. Develop a pattern that lets you control the numbers, and then stick with it.\nPut a Name and a Face on Every Line in the Income Statement\nBreak down the major categories on the income statement into controllable elements, and then assign each element to someone in the company.\nThat person will then be responsible for reporting the number in the meeting. You do this to give ownership to that number and humanize the business. By attaching real people to the numbers, people no longer go on the offensive when the numbers are not up to par. Instead, they ask what we can do to help. There’s a personal connection. People have an innate want to support each other. When one person is down, someone else steps in and picks him or her up.\nInvite Anyone with Something to Contribute\nRegardless of the frequency, staff meetings are open to everyone in the company. Depending on the size of your company, it may be everyone on staff, or you might only see the people with a number to report, news to share, or it’s important for them to see what is happening across the company. There should never be any mystery when the meeting is happening, where it is, or who is invited. If you are a large company and do not feel you can bring everyone together each week for one big meeting, then read our blog post on Huddle Cycles. We provide helpful information on how to be transparent across large workforces.\nHave a Fixed Format, But Don’t Be Boring\nHave a simple format that never varies, and be sure the content is interesting and fast-paced. No one wants to sit through a long, drawn-out meeting without purpose.\n- Start with setting the tone for the meeting and establishing a theme - this is usually led by leadership. Keep it brief and concise.\n- Then go around the room twice:\n- The first time around, you will go through the income statement in the manner described above. When finished, everyone should understand how the company is doing against the pretax profit goal. Meanwhile, the chief financial officer quickly puts together a Cash-Flow Statement, using the numbers that people have just announced, and goes over the results. (At The Great Game of Business, we automate this with a Cash-Flow Statement document. If you don't have one, feel free to download ours.)\n- The second time around, people report any news or other information they feel the group wants to hear— new customers, important milestones, industry awards, fishing results, golf results, individual accomplishments, etc. This part has the flavor of a town meeting, with each member getting up to tell us a little bit about what’s happening in his or her neighborhood. There is much joking, commiserating, congratulating, and laughing. We are renewing the bonds of our community.\n- Close the meeting with a summary of the results. It is always good to come back to the theme discussed at the start of the meeting or pick up on something one of the other participants has said. The purpose is simply to highlight whatever you think our common focus should be, based on what we’ve just heard and what is happening around us, the environment we are operating in. Then we adjourn.\nBe a Leader, Not a Boss.\nIf you are running the meeting, be careful to avoid the trap of being the person with all the answers. You never want people to think they are reporting to you to tell them what to do. It’s important to keep putting the responsibility and the tools for earning more in their hands. It’s easy to come in after the fact and say, “You should have done this or that.” But, if you do, they’ll start leaving the decisions up to you. Empower them to make decisions by providing tools. The best tool you have is the financial statements. So we’re all moving in the same direction. There aren’t any more mixed messages, just the results on the financials.\nUse this as a means to lead and teach.\nMake Sure the Numbers Get Out\nNever forget, what happens after the Huddle is more important than what happens in it. The whole exercise is a big waste of time if the information stays with the people in the room. This is not a big concern if your company is small enough to have everyone in the Huddle, but if your company is large, you need to have a routine to get the information out to the rest of the company. That’s why we put so much emphasis on the small, short standup Huddles. We hold as many as necessary to get the word out as fast as possible. In a small department, there may be only one. In a large department, there may be as many as eight. The head of production, for example, meets with all seven of the frontline supervisors on the shop floor. They then go back and hold similar sessions with their respective teams. In each meeting, people are not only getting the numbers and the news, but they are also figuring out what they can do to improve the score.\nInsist That People Write It Down\nAn essential step in the whole educational process is writing down the information. When you report to people every week about the company’s condition, you establish credibility. When you get them to write the information down, you teach. Education comes by repetition. It’s like learning the multiplication tables. If you do it often enough, it becomes second nature. That’s what you want. You want to be sure that you are really teaching people what they need to know— that you are taking ignorance out of the workplace and educating people to understand what needs to be done.\nTo hear more helpful tips on educating, empowering, and engaging your workforce, download a free copy of The Great Game of Business.",

    "content": "Your strategic plan is finally complete; you’ve analyzed the data, prioritized market opportunities, and addressed the strategic issues. You’ve outlined strategic areas of focus, company-wide goals, and KPIs for the next 1-3 years. The only thing left to do is implement… Easy, right?\nWhen you share the strategic plan with your organization, those responsible for executing your carefully designed strategy will be wondering what are the day-to-day outcomes and how they’ll be delivered. It’s human nature for your team to wonder who is in charge of executing and reporting on OKRs and when should OKRs be completed? Folks may look at your big, bold vision and strategic goals and wonder how on earth will you track and report on progress.\nYour planning team expects its strategic plan to succeed, but it’s the planning teams’ responsibility to set employees up for implementation success. A plan is not truly implementation-ready unless a few final details are buttoned up:\n- SMART Objectives with descriptive Key Results\n- OKR Champions\n- Start- and end-dates\n- Measurements of success (quantitative measures or project progress)\n- End-of-year & incremental targets\nLet’s walk through the checklist to ensure you’re implementation-ready.\nSMART OKRs\nObjectives are the company-wide “WHATs”—what needs to be achieved, created or shifted. Objectives are implementation-ready if they are written using SMART language to clearly communicate what must be accomplished in the next 1-3 years to achieve your long-term Strategic Goals. As a refresher:\n- Specific (the result or outcome is singular and focused, describing what is different than today)\n- Measurable (either in terms of a quantitative measure or in terms of percent complete or progress against key effort milestones)\n- Actionable (embedded in the outcome is a crystal-clear action and outcome)\n- Responsible (assigns accountability to a person, not a department or a functional area)\n- Timebound (details presumed start- and end-dates so the person responsible understands when they’re supposed to begin and complete the OKR)\nIf you need some tips on setting long-term Strategic Goals and aligned Annual Objectives, check out this article!\nKey Results are the “HOWs” that support the “WHAT” (Objective). KRs provide the starting place for your team to achieve the Objectives. KRs break down Objectives into quarterly or monthly initiatives detailing how the objective will be achieved; they also provide leading performance information about an objective’s progress. When you discuss progress of your OKRs at your weekly or monthly performance reviews, KRs help to focus the conversations on how you’re progressing, where you’re stuck and what is needed to get unstuck.\nOKR Champions\nWho is responsible for what? Every Objective and each KR in your plan needs a champion responsible for managing execution and reporting on progress. Only one, single champion should be identified for each objective and each KR; while OKRs usually take a team to execute, the champion leads the team along the way and reports progress back to Leadership. There’s nothing worse than getting halfway through the year and wondering why your team hasn’t made progress on OKRs—often, the cause is a lack of understanding of who was the champion responsible; then no one advanced the OKRs. The other most common cause of lack of progress is lack of clarity of what the objective’s outcome is and no definition of KRs to guide how to get it done.\nIs Your Plan Implementation-Ready?\nStart- & End-Dates\nOKRs need start- and end-dates to provide timeframes for who is doing what by when, and guardrails for how long we have to achieve the “what” or complete the ”how.” Generally, start- and end-dates should follow the guidelines of the plan structure (e.g., KRs are monthly). Of course, some OKRs may be achieved faster than anticipated; some may hit roadblocks along the way that result in going beyond the anticipated end-date. For this reason, teams should meet monthly or at least quarterly to adjust timing as circumstances shift—because if we’ve learned anything in the past 2 years, man, can circumstances shift.\nCheck out our video on adopting an agile planning process.\nMeasurements of Success\nMeasures allow OKR champions to track and report progress and ensures that there is much less subjectivity about that progress. Generally, there are two types of measures:\n- Percent Complete: Used for effort-based or project type OKRs. You will know, by your best managerial estimate, when a goal is 25%, 50%, or 100% complete.*\n- Quantitative: Verifiable results based on a relevant data source ($, #, % increase/decrease). When identifying quantitative measures, also identify the data source for a bullet-proof, single source of truth.\n*To tighten up the percent complete measure, we often describe progress milestones for each incremental target, e.g., 25% = audit is complete and project objectives are approved; 50% = committee has met at least once and the implementation plan is submitted to leadership.\nEnd-of-Year & Incremental Targets\nAn end-of-year target sets the target or outcome for the year or term of the multi-year OKR. End-of-year targets are critical to assess what the organization is attempting to accomplish and identifies where you want to be by when.\nIncremental targets compare current progress to where progress / performance should be at a point-in-time (not just the end-of-year or completion date of goal). If progress is only assessed at the end of an OKR’s timeframe, there is no room to adjust during implementation and without incremental targets it’s likely you’ll be blindsided at the end of the year by those OKRs that will not be completed when planned—we like surprises for birthdays, but think they’re no bueno in business. Incremental targets (either weekly, monthly or quarterly) provide checkpoints along the way to assess where we should shift resources or focus. If in month 4 of a 12-month OKR, you’re way behind where you thought you would be, have that super interesting and strategic (!) discussion about whether you need to change the approach, change the incremental targets and end-date, or pause the OKR altogether to focus resources.\nPro Tips\n- Identify the 1-3 key must-dos (Key Results) to complete each Objective. Start each KR with an action verb (e.g., Create, Build) and clearly articulate successful completion (SMART).\n- When identifying KRs, also consider if you have the budget and\ncapabilities needed to achieve the desired outcome. - After setting champions, consider if any one individual has too many OKRs on their plate. Will they have the time and resources to champion all OKRs, or should ownership be redistributed, or do you need to ‘rack and stack’ that person’s OKRs so that they don’t all start at the same time?\n- If an OKR is a team effort, consider assigning contributors. Contributors can outline the team or group responsible for executing the goal. OnStrategy’s App is built to do this easily and without confusing who is the champion and who are the contributors.\n- Identify rules/guidelines for target-setting across all goals and you’ll maintain consistency, especially for percent complete OKRs: e.g., all percent complete OKRs will be measured in increments of 10 or 25 percentage points (no increments of 3 ppts!); and set monthly / weekly / quarterly incremental targets to align with your strategy review schedule.\n- Your incremental targets must add up to or equal the desired target and measure type communicated in the OKR statement. Matchy-matchy outfits are boring, but articulating the end target in an OKR and having your measure match what the OKR promises is going to avoid confusion:\n| Example: | Objective: Achieve an average monthly volume of 200 |\n| Target month 1: average monthly volume of 175 | |\n| Target month 2: average monthly volume of 180 | |\n| Target month 3: average monthly volume of 200 | |\n| Target month 4: average monthly volume of 200 | |\n| And so on… |\nSure, the last mile of a strategic planning marathon can be challenging with all the needed details, but we see time and again that finishing the marathon with these implementation-ready tips ensures teams are set up to successfully implement their strategy and achieve results, which is really why you started the marathon after all. Check out this handy guide to ensure your strategic plan is implementation-ready and then go crush the targets and conquer the results to achieve your big, bold vision!",

This can vary based on how many calories you need to consume every day, but most people aim to limit their carbs to no more than 50 grams per day.\nWhat can you eat on the keto diet?\nThe keto diet is a high-fat eating plan, so you’ll want to include fats in each of your meals and snacks. Your fats could come from cooking oils, high-fat dairy products, meat, poultry, avocado, nuts or eggs. Try to eat a wide variety of keto foods to avoid getting bored with your meals.",

    "content": "The Dark Side Of OKRs (And Why We Should Care)\nIf we could tag one apocalyptic rider for adaptive organizations, it would be \"traditional performance management.\" It is old-fashioned performance management that keeps us in a world of humans as resources, as command-and-control takers, with rigid top-down planning, and solid prevention of curious and exploratively-minded cooperation. Its logic is plan – do – check – act.\nA logic, where individual goals are defined top-down from corporate objectives, any doing is checked against this goal accomplishment in the form of \"feedback,\" and carrots are used to enable \"pigeon training.\"\nMost of us will agree that all of this is true for old-school management by objectives, but do we realize that some of the new co-creation tools – such as OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) – are maybe not much better?\nAt its core, management by objectives fulfills three different management functions where goals are to: a) coordinate and align individual and team efforts with those of the organization, b) channel information on those aspects most important from a corporate perspective, and c) create a motivating push.\nOrganizations that opt for adaptiveness, agility, and resilience have started to reform this goal process to enable decentral coordination and learning by allowing for much more participation, bottom-up input, and co-creation, thereby relinquishing the information monopoly.\nFor instance, so-called \"FAST goals\" are Frequently discussed (quicker-paced and more bottom-up), Ambitious (difficult, but not impossible to reach), Specific (concretized by measurable milestones), and Transparent (shared within and across teams).\nHence, these goals take local knowledge onboard and make sure that coordination is not dependent on hierarchy. The same logic applies to OKRs.\nBetter? Yes, but not all good!\nBecause irrespective of whether FAST goals or OKRs are applied – the spirit of pigeon training is still present as both bank on \"make your goals specific\", \"be overambitious\", and \"show everyone what you have accomplished anytime\".\nThus, these goals should come with a warning: \"May prevent human ingenuity and co-creation to take place.\"\nTo be fair, they have a mighty motivation theory on their side when doing this: the goal-setting approach.\nThis theory has sparked a lot of what we take for granted in business but also coaching, namely: (1) goals are needed, (2) specific goals are better than \"do your best goals\" as these provide direction and a clear focus, and (3) ambitious goals exert a stronger motivating push than realistic goals.\nYet, in recent years, several studies have shown that the very success factors of such goals carry downsides, which are particularly problematic for agile organizations and co-creation. These are rooted in largely ignored psychological side-effects, which should be taken into account when working with goals.\nSpecific goals can make you blind\nSpecific management goals give a focus but at the same time can also act as blinders and thereby prevent out-of-the-box thinking. Do you know the \"invisible gorilla experiment\"?\nIn this experiment, participants were exposed to a short video with players passing a basketball. They then got the specific goal to count how many times the ball was passed.\nThis simple instruction prevented half of the participants from spotting a giant gorilla passing by the ballplayers – it was as if the gorilla was invisible. Why? Because the attention was focused squarely on the task.\nSpecific goals thus can undermine mindfulness and spotting the unfamiliar, unplanned event. Therefore, it turns out that for agile and creative work that is to respond to changing environments and enable exploration, some amount of goal fuzziness can be helpful.\nAnd by the way – the right amount of fuzziness needs to be teased out by experimentation as there is no handy formula for this.\nOverambitiousness creates unwanted overheating\nBesides, it is almost impossible to determine the right amount of ambitiousness.\nSure ambitious goals trigger \"fire\" or, more prosaic, a strong will to succeed. But what has become clear, too, and should not be ignored: overambitious goals – as argued for in FAST and OKRs - carry a lot of risks.\nFirst: if goals are too ambitious and humans never stand a chance to reach these goals, their self-efficacy can deteriorate. However, self-efficacy is a needed resource if we want humans that have a curious, open, and pro-active mindset.\nSecond: for overconfident humans, on the other hand, ambitious goals create such a will that every means to attain the goals are used. Hence, overambitious goals can also evoke gambling behavior.\nThird: overambitious goals – particularly when enacted as \"preventing sandbagging\" as a standard instrument, can lead to emotional depletion, even to the degree that out of this depleted state, employees start to show unethical behaviors . Hence the manipulation of \"ambition\" can backfire – enormously.\nTransparency meets privacy needs\nA further challenge comes with the transparency principle. In its original design, both OKRs and FAST goals bank on individual transparency – everybody knows everybody's goals as well as goal achievements. Yet here, too, psychological research shows some downsides.\nFirst, the balance between transparency and privacy is a delicate one. Too much exposure can backfire as this can feel like a panopticon, a hardly visible but strongly felt control. Consequently, team members start to withhold information or dress-up their image rather than sharing freely and commenting helpfully on the collective work process .\nSecond, the so-called effect of mere presence triggers either social facilitation or inhibition. Imagine your playing the guitar either alone or in front of an audience. Sometimes, others' \"mere\" presence leads to a performance never achieved before, but sometimes, felt pressure and anxiety make free and creative play impossible.\nThe bad news for knowledge and creative work is that the decisive factor, whether performance increases or decreases with others watching is task complexity and difficulty. The more challenging and more complex a task, the more likely fear kicks in, and performance falters .\nAnd now? Unsmart your goals!\nWhere does this leave us?\nClear goals are still needed to enable thriving and making progress. But these management goals are better co-created and defined on the team level: in this way, teams can define their own criteria of success, while for team-members, some room for maneuver is left.\nAlso, ungoaled time - free time - enables the needed incubation for creativity and innovation.\nBesides, moonshot goals create inspiration – but these ideally come in the form of a long-term \"Everest goal\" – directed toward abundance and the greater good in mind and not toward specific overambitious output targets.\nAnd finally, goal transparency can be an information sharing and co-creation booster, but not without leaving room for experimentation in privacy.\nOr, as an alternative summary: Just because Google made it famous does not mean we should embrace an instrument as \"best practice.\" Sometimes unsmarter, less engineered \"nonfoci Rs\" might work better.\nThis is a guest post by Antoinette Weibel, professor for HRM (and secretly also for leadership) at the University of St. Gallen, and Meike Wiemann, a senior researcher, project manager and lecturer at the University of St.Gallen.

    "content": "Building a culture of learning at work\nHow leaders can create the psychological safety for people to constantly rethink what’s possible.\nA few years ago, leaders at the Gates Foundation reached out to see if I could help them improve their culture. They already had a strong culture of performance: They hired world-class scientists and maintained excellence of execution. Their goal was to improve their learning culture, in which people have the humility to know what they don’t know and the curiosity to rethink the way they’ve always done things.\nWhen I first arrived, people were whispering about the annual strategy reviews. It’s the time when program teams across the foundation meet with the cochairs — Bill and Melinda Gates — and the CEO to give progress reports on execution and collect feedback. Leaders were concerned that the pressure to present airtight analyses was discouraging people from taking risks. They often stuck to tried‑and‑true strategies that would make incremental progress rather than daring to undertake bold experiments that might make a bigger dent in some of the world’s most vexing problems.\nThe foundation of a learning culture is psychological safety — being able to take risks without fear of reprisal. Evidence shows that when teams have psychological safety, they’re more willing to acknowledge their own mistakes and figure out how to prevent them moving forward. They’re also more comfortable raising problems and exploring innovative solutions.\nThe standard advice for managers on building psychological safety is to model openness and inclusiveness: Ask for feedback on how you can improve, and people will feel it’s safe to take risks. To test whether that recommendation would work, I had launched an experiment with a doctoral student, Constantinos Coutifaris. In multiple companies, we randomly assigned some managers to ask their teams for constructive criticism. Over the following week, their teams reported higher psychological safety, but as we anticipated, it didn’t last. Some managers who asked for feedback didn’t like what they heard and got defensive. Others found the feedback useless or felt helpless to act on it, which discouraged them from continuing to seek feedback and their teams from continuing to offer it.\nAnother group of managers took a different approach, one that had a less immediate impact in the first week but led to sustainable gains in psychological safety a full year later. Instead of asking them to seek feedback, we had randomly assigned those managers to share their past experiences with receiving feedback and their future development goals. We advised them to tell their teams about a time when they benefited from constructive criticism and to identify the areas that they were working to improve now.\nBy admitting some of their imperfections out loud, managers demonstrated that they could take it — and made a public commitment to remain open to feedback. They normalized vulnerability, making their teams more comfortable opening up about their own struggles. Their employees gave more useful feedback, because they knew where their managers were working to grow. That motivated managers to create practices to keep the door open: They started holding “ask me anything” coffee chats, opening weekly one‑on‑one meetings by asking for constructive criticism, and setting up monthly team sessions where everyone shared their development goals and progress.\nCreating psychological safety can’t be an isolated episode or a task to check off on a to‑do list. When discussing their weaknesses, many of the managers in our experiment felt awkward and anxious at first. Many of their team members were surprised by that vulnerability and unsure of how to respond. Some were skeptical: They thought their managers might be fishing for compliments or cherry‑picking comments that made them look good. It was only over time — as managers repeatedly demonstrated humility and curiosity — that the dynamic changed.\nAt the Gates Foundation, I wanted to go a step further. Instead of just having managers open up with their own teams about how they had previously been criticized, I wondered what would happen if senior leaders shared their experiences across the entire organization. It dawned on me that I had a memorable way to make that happen.\nA few years earlier, our MBA students at Wharton had decided to create a video for their annual comedy show. It was inspired by Mean Tweets, the late‑night segment on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in which celebrities read cruel tweets about themselves out loud. Our version was Mean Reviews, where faculty members would read harsh comments from student course evaluations. “This is possibly the worst class I’ve ever taken in my life,” one professor read, looking defeated before saying, “Fair enough.” One of my own was “You remind me of a Muppet.”\nI made it a habit to show that video in class every fall, and afterward the floodgates would open. Students seemed to be more comfortable sharing their criticisms and suggestions for improvement after seeing that, although I take my work seriously, I don’t take myself too seriously. I sent the video to Melinda Gates, asking whether she thought something similar might help with psychological safety in her organization. She not only said yes; she challenged the entire executive leadership team to participate and volunteered to be the first to take the hot seat. Her team compiled criticisms from staff surveys, printed them on note cards, and had her react in real time in front of a camera. She read one employee’s complaint that she was like Mary F***ing Poppins — the first time anyone could remember hearing Melinda curse — and then explained how she was working on making her imperfections more visible.\nTo test the impact of her presentation, we randomly assigned one group of employees to watch Melinda engage with the tough comments, a second to watch a video of her talking about the culture she wanted to create in more general terms, and a third to serve as a pure control group. The first group came away with the strongest growth mindsets — they were inspired to recognize their shortcomings and work to overcome them.\nBut mindsets aren’t enough to transform a culture. Although psychological safety erases the fear of challenging authority, it doesn’t necessarily motivate us to question authority in the first place. To build a learning culture, we also need to create a specific kind of accountability — one that leads people to think again about their decisions.\nTo build a learning culture, we need to create a specific kind of accountability — one that leads people to think again about their decisions.\nIn performance cultures, people are held accountable for results: Did their projects succeed or fail? But social scientists find that focusing only on outcomes makes it too easy for people to continue with ill‑fated courses of action. It isn’t until a high‑stakes decision goes horribly wrong that people pause to reexamine their practices. Focusing on results might be good for short‑term performance, but it can be an obstacle to long‑term learning.\nIn learning cultures, people don’t stop keeping score. They expand the scorecard to hold others accountable for processes as well as outcomes. Even if the outcome of a decision is positive, it doesn’t necessarily qualify as a success. If the process was shallow, you were lucky. If the decision process was deep, you can count it as an improvement: You’ve discovered a better practice. If the outcome is negative, it’s a failure only if the decision process was shallow. If the result was negative but you evaluated the decision thoroughly, you’ve run a smart experiment.\nThe ideal time to run those experiments is when decisions are relatively inconsequential or reversible. In too many organizations, leaders look for guarantees that the results will be favorable before testing or investing in something new. It’s the equivalent of telling Gutenberg you’d only bankroll his printing press once he had a long line of satisfied customers — or announcing to a group of HIV researchers that you’d only fund their clinical trials after their treatments worked.\nRequiring proof is an enemy of progress. This is why companies like Amazon use a principle of disagree and commit. As Jeff Bezos explained it in an annual shareholder letter, instead of demanding convincing results, experiments start with asking people to make bets. “Look, I know we disagree on this, but will you gamble with me on it?” The goal in a learning culture is to welcome these kinds of experiments, to make rethinking so familiar that it becomes routine and people don’t hesitate to pitch new ideas.\nIn performance cultures, people often become attached to best practices. The risk is that once we’ve declared a routine the best, it becomes frozen in time. We preach about its virtues and stop questioning its vices, no longer curious about where it’s imperfect and where it could improve. Organizational learning should be an ongoing activity, but best practices imply it has reached an end point. We might be better off searching for better practices.\nThat’s what we were after at the Gates Foundation. When Melinda and her colleagues shared their mean reviews, some of the power distance evaporated. Afterward, employees weren’t afraid to dish it out — they knew their leaders could take it. People were less afraid to be vulnerable and more likely to reach out to senior leaders with both problems and solutions. In performance cultures, people are determined to prove themselves. But in learning cultures, people are more interested in improving themselves — and the organization around them.\nAuthor profile:\n- Adam Grant is an organizational psychologist at the Wharton School, the host of the TED podcast WorkLife, and the author of Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don’t Know.\n- Excerpted from Think Again, by Adam Grant, published on February 2, 2021, by Viking, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC.

    "content": "Over the last few years, I've had the incredible privilege to travel all over the world speaking to amazing organizations and people. Whether I'm speaking to a group of BNI networkers or a 1,000+ audience at a national convention, wherever I go there always seems to be other coaches in attendance. The most common seem to be a life coach, health coach, or business executive coach. Regardless of what \"type\" of coach they are, there are some very similar patterns that you see in the ones who are unbelievably successful and clearly defined patterns in the ones you see that are struggling immensely. Struggling not only to stay congruent with the message they teach and tools they share with their clients, but also struggling financially and in their business.\nMost coaches have huge hearts and really want to make a valuable difference in their clients lives, yet can only seem to get a few clients at a time. They spend their days reading and learning as much information as they possibly can. They attend tons of events, webinars and seminars focused on learning great information to share with their clients. If this sounds all too familiar, my goal is to help you become the best coach you can be, so please take note of these 6 reasons by most life and business coaches fail:\n5. Jack of All Trades, Not a Master of One.\nThis one is a real doozy. The coach who is pretty good a lot of different things and is so excited to share their knowledge with their clients, yet fails miserably to differentiate themselves because they are, frankly, a dime a dozen. The best thing you could do as a coach, for your coaching business your clients, is to pick a maximum of 3, very specific topics to coach on. If you're a life coach, what specific part of life will you focus on? The more targeted and focused you are, the more focused your clients will be, and the better results you'll and your clients will see.\n4. It's Not About Motivation. Just because you are able to get people fired up, doesn't mean you're a great coach. In fact the mere definition of motivate is to give someone a motive to do something. That does not mean they'll actually do it. Most any coach can give great strategies. The difference in going from good to great in coaching is getting your clients to actually take action. It's not about being a great motivator. it's about being a powerful influencer. Once you've mastered the art of influence, you'll be able to do more than give strategies, you'll actually have an effect on your clients which makes them want to take action. A personal favorite, and valuable resource on this topic is the book Influence by PhD Robert B. Cialdini.\n3. You Put Your Motives First. This one actually saddens me to hear. As a business or life coach, it is imperative that you focus on what your coaching clients want and need, NOT what you want. Your motives should ONLY be their motives. The second you prioritize what you think is important versus what your coaching client thinks is important, you have failed tremendously. Their needs always come before your needs (This goes for any relationship you want to last).\n2. One Approach. We've all heard the phrase \"it's like beating a dead horse\". If you're not getting through to your coaching clients, it's not them, it's YOU. When you have only one approach your level of influence will suffer tremendously and neither you, nor your clients, will see results. Having only one approach is like driving down a dead-end road, it's unlikely you'll ever reach your destination (read: desired outcome). Just because one approach or strategy worked for you before, it does not mean it'll work every time. To learn about strategic intervention and the ability to create lasting change check out the Robbins-Madanes Training For Strategic Intervention -- http://www.rmtcenter.com\n1. You don't LIVE IT. Time and time again, I hear \"I love that you're actually LIVING what you teach.\" I mean, why on Earth would you coach someone on something you don't, or wouldn't do, yourself. People can smell bull dung from a mile away. If you want to be the best business or life coach in the industry, you need to do more than just learn and give your knowledge. You need to start living it! I recently gave a TEDx talk on my philosophy of \"Learn It. LIVE it. Give it\", a simple formula to help inspire the world. It's gives insight into why so many people truly haven't reached their potential in life and business and inspires them to take action. I hope it does the same for you and your coaching business.",

    "content": "5 Rules for Leading Excellent Meetings with Your Team Every Day\nSuccessful businesses do the things that others know they should do …. but generally don’t.\n~ Ari Weinzwig’s 7th Natural Law of Business\nSo let’s talk about those things you need to do to run great everyday business meetings with your teams. And yes, I’m going to share some guidelines you may already know.\nHopefully, you’ll be inspired to follow them.\nIt’s worth the effort. The leaders we’ve met who follow these “rules” enjoy more productivity, more loyalty, more engagement, better decision making, and less BS drama between team members than everyone else. And frankly, none of this is actually that hard to do.\nHere are five rules for team meetings that I share with my business clients, and that I wish someone had taught me when I started my business.\nLet’s look at the details.\nRule 1. Design your meeting system.\nMost advice you’ll see about meetings tells you to create an agenda, or stand up, or keep it short, or some other set of simplistic steps you’re supposed to follow every time you schedule a meeting.\nBusiness leaders don’t have time to follow any list of “should do” steps every time they need to meet, no matter how simple or brilliant that list might be.\nYou do not have time for that!\nInstead, you need to sit down and design how your team works-your Way of Working-once. It’s a system. Then, you go to work, and you tweak it as you go.\nDo you work with a sales consultant or product development coach? These professionals will give you language for many of the meetings you’ll use in your sales and product development processes, so you already have what you need to design those conversations.\nYou need to take the same care with the rest of your internal meetings. What does your weekly team meeting look like? How often do you review lessons learned? How do you bring on a new team member? How do you meet to make sure your projects are on track? What’s your approach to performance management?\nEach and every one of these meetings can be mapped out as a part of how your team gets work done. If you don’t have any of this in place yet, this article provides an example of one way this might look.\nRule 2. Take and review notes every time.\nYou should have records from all of your meetings except for the purely social events and any meetings in which you agree to a life of crime. Don’t document your evil plans.\nOtherwise, you want records for everything else, because those meetings created new value for your business.\nIn the section dedicated to meeting records in our course on science-backed meeting rules, Dr. Joseph Allen shares an experiment he ran with several teams at a large company.\nHere’s how it worked. One team was asked to write down action items and review them before the end of their meetings. The other teams didn’t make any changes.\nTheir findings? The team that simply wrote down what they’d decided and what they agreed to do quickly outperformed all the other teams.\nSo simple! So obvious! But very few teams do it, so they end up rehashing the same conversations many times. That’s just dumb and wasteful.\nIf you haven’t already, capturing meeting records is the simplest meeting discipline you can adopt, and because most teams don’t bother, it gives you a serious competitive advantage.\nHere’s one way those meeting records will pay off.\nRule 3. Rotate responsibility.\nOnce you’ve designed your way of working, and established a regular habit of recording the decisions and action items that come out of those meetings, you no longer have to run the meetings.\nIn fact, it’s better for you and your team if you don’t.\nInstead, take turns. Give each person on your team a meeting job to do, then rotate those jobs on a regular basis. One person prepares the agenda and keeps the conversation on track. One person watches the time. One takes notes.\nBy doing this, you’re not only making your life easier, you’re also building the capacity of your team. You are creating more leaders who you can trust to take on more of the customer-facing work.\nFinally, when your team can run great meetings and documents the results, you don’t have to always go to the meeting. If you, like me, have times where you need to work with a client or go on vacation, you can do that without worrying you’ll miss out. Your team knows what to do, they’ve had practice, and they’ll take great notes you can review when you’re back.\nRule 4. Build a home for stuff that comes up.\nMost of us are pretty good at drawing up plans for the way we think our businesses ought to run, so I’m sure you’ll be able to pull a core Way of Working plan together.\nYou can absolutely do that, and you should. That’s the number one rule!\nAnd like all plans, your plan will also be kind of crap.\nWhen you plan, you’ll think you only need one meeting per week with your team, but then stuff comes up. You think you’ll need to refresh your strategy every 90 days, but then there will be something like, oh, say a pandemic? And there goes that strategy.\nDoes that mean your design work was futile? No – just incomplete.\nInstead, every business owner needs to create a home for the “stuff comes up” stuff. Most don’t. Most let stuff that comes up spill willy-nilly all over their calendars, which erodes any chance your team has of getting work done on time.\nTo get in front of that, dedicate time on your calendar for “stuff”. Create at least one hour, every week, where your team can come with the stuff and work through it together.\nAt Zingerman’s, team members bring topics marked with what they need out of the discussion (e.g., A for announcement, H for help, D for decision) and how much time they need to talk it through. Coda holds a “Bullpen” every week, where everyone must attend and small groups can work out the little “stuff” that doesn’t fit in other meetings. Teams from dental offices to complexity scientists use a real-time agenda.\nWhatever mechanism you choose, the goal is this: if something needs to be discussed that doesn’t fit in your pre-designed meetings, you can talk about it there.\nPut this in place and you and your team will gain control over your calendars; short of a true emergency, you’ll be able to predict your meeting schedule and plan for uninterrupted focus time around it.\nRule 5. Bake in a culture that will make you and your team proud.\nMeetings are about productivity and results and getting work done.\nMeetings are also about:\n- relationships\n- fun\n- inclusion\n- meaning\n- belonging!\nMeetings are concentrated culture in action.\nMeetings are the most frequently repeated, most visible, and most powerful opportunity you have to model and live your desired corporate culture. Don’t waste that opportunity.\nNowhere is it easier to see the beliefs that drive your team forward and the beliefs that hold you back.\nIf your culture encourages power struggles, blame, and evasion, you’ll see it when you meet. If you like to have fun, or if you’re passionate about the work, you’ll see that too.\nSo how can you ensure your meetings reflect the culture you want?\nFirst, consider what you call your meetings and how you describe what you’re doing in the meeting.\nFor example, would you run a check-in, a stand-up, a huddle, a synch-up, an adrenaline call, or a fusion cell? These are all names different teams have given to a functionally identical meeting as a way to make it their own.\nIn social psychology circles, they call this use of intentional language priming or framing. The way you frame a meeting sets the tone and the boundaries, and shifts how everyone shows up.\nAnother example: check out this Twitter thread of stories about how the names a team gives their meeting rooms can impact how they feel about those meetings.\nNext, look to your rituals.\nSome companies design meetings that are nothing but ritual. Awards ceremonies, virtual happy hours – each of these gatherings works to strengthen the group’s shared identity.\nGreat rituals don’t have to take up a whole meeting, though. Many of the most effective rituals provide meaning to the start and end of meetings.\nFor example, the Canadian government convened a series of meetings between First Nations representatives and government ministers with a goal of improving relations. The first few were rough. The issues involved go way back, everyone had a vested interest to protect, and the discussion turned ugly.\nThen, they changed how they began the meetings. Instead of just calling the meeting to order and launching into the agenda, they invited a First Nations elder to open meetings with a smudging. Smudging is a traditional ceremony used to clear negative energy and bless a space. The smudging did its job and reset the energy. Ministers who had been defensive began to listen, ask questions, and offer solutions.\nAs one witness related, “It was amazing. Such a small thing, but it made a huge difference.”\nWhich brings us full circle.\nIn business, we have so many meetings that they all blur together.\nWe forget sometimes that we, as business leaders, hold the power to transform those many otherwise forgettable, small moments into something memorable and powerful.\nWhen we apply design, intention, and a healthy heap of love into how we show up with our teams, that’s when we start to build the companies that others hope to become.\nSuccessful businesses leaders meet the way others know they should do …. but generally don’t.\nAs you build your meetings into something amazing, I hope you will share your stories too. I look forward to being inspired by the great good you create as you step up to lead excellent everyday meetings with your team.\nNeed help with that? Get in touch. This is what we do.",

    "content": "When done properly and for the right reasons, performance reviews give employees the kind of feedback and recognition they crave. Everyone on your team deserves feedback, whether they are remote, hybrid or working in the office for the long-term.\nHow the switch to remote work has affected productivity and performance management\nFor companies who are adapting work environments to remote or hybrid situations, it can be unsettling to have less transparency into what employees are doing. Leaders feel in the dark about how much progress has been made on projects and worry about accountability.\nBut the solution isn’t micromanagement—instead, it’s increased transparency and more precise communication. It’s also important to acknowledge that when working practices change, it might not make sense to use the same measurements and objectives as before.\nWhy reviews are as important as ever\nWhen your employees are working from varying locations, we need to communicate more, not less. Don’t allow remote workers to operate within an information vacuum—you might need to communicate (or even over-communicate) far more than you did previously. Remember, the goal of a performance review is to provide feedback on your employees’ performance. Even if your workers are remote, there are always valuable lessons and opportunities worth reflecting on.\nThe reality is, the right course of action will differ by individual. High performers won’t want to waste an opportunity to grow and may seek acknowledgment that being remote won’t knock their career trajectory off course. Others will need managers’ support as they align their own performance with company goals. For many, remote work doesn’t come naturally—and their efforts to adjust should be recognized.\nHow to conduct remote performance reviews\nHere are a few helpful tips for conducting remote performance reviews:\n- State the purpose of the review\nMake sure employees know that a review is part of an on-going conversation, even when you’ve had to change-up your performance review process. If you’re doing talent development right, your team will already be accustomed to regular feedback conversations. - Reflect on lessons learned and how to apply them\nThe best employee feedback is future-focused, and that’s never been more true than now. Even if moving to remote work was tough at first, the important question is how an employee is set up for future success. Acknowledge the challenges that have gone before, and work together on how the lessons learned can provide opportunities for growth. - Turn your cameras on\nSo much of our communication is non-verbal, and this is lost when cameras are off. You’ll never recreate the rich non-verbal communication of in-person conversation, but making an effort to really be present in video calls makes a big different.\nA transparent performance review process helps companies perform and align around their goals. It’s instrumental in shaping behaviors, encouraging ownership, self-direction, peer recognition and openness.\nMore tips and info about conducting effective performance reviews\nEnsure that employee goals are well defined, especially in the context of your company or team’s performance review process. Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), a popular goal-setting methodology, can help you achieve this. Here’s a quick checklist of what a strong performance expectation should include:\n- Alignment with core values and company goals\n- Culturally aligned behaviors that drive optimal organizational outcomes\n- Demonstrations of optimal outcomes\n- Metrics that show expectations have been met\n- Mutual agreement between employee, manager and company\nEnsure that employee goals are well defined, especially in the context of your company or team’s performance review process. Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), a popular goal-setting methodology, can help you achieve this.\nPerformance management should be an ongoing process that allows for discussion, improvement and adjustments based on employee performance. To make the review process easier, consider conducting check-ins and tracking that you can reference often. Paycor Talent Development can help turn your performance management process into an ongoing conversation and create a culture of continuous development—including for remote employees.\nHow Paycor Helps\nPaycor builds HR solutions for leaders.

    "title": "4 common challenges scaling leaders face — and how to overcome them",
    "domain": "sifted.eu",
    "age": "1,523 days ago",
    "content": "“After working in your first scaleup, you think ‘this place is crazy’,” Gillian Davis, founder of Overtime Leader and partner of Tech Nation’s Advance: Scaling Leaders programme, told Sifted.\n“Then you go and work at your next one and you realise — this is just working in a scaleup. It’s just the nature of working in a high-growth company.”\nAccording to Tech Nation, 23% of scaleups fail because they don’t have the right team or lack experienced leadership. So what can scaling leaders do to prepare?\nSifted spoke to Davis, as well as several graduates of Tech Nation’s Advance: Scaling Leaders programme, to find out how leaders in scaling tech companies — from heads of sales and CTOs to marketing managers and HR directors — can overcome common scaling and leadership challenges, including: Loral Quinn, founding CEO of social impact fintech Sustainably; Jennifer Brady, marketing executive at SaaS fintech Lightyear; and Sinead Daly, director of culture and experience at recruitment platform Beamery.\n1. Future-proofing work processes for future growth\nIn a startup’s early days, founders often have to think about their immediate day to day responsibilities, rather than planning for when their team is 200 employees strong or expanding into new countries.\nQuinn, whose startup Sustainably is pre-seed, says keeping these future decisions in mind early on has been key: “The sooner you think of these things, the more likely that you're not going to create problems for yourself later on. Even scaling from four to eight people or from eight to 16 — if you don't get the processes right early, you know you're going to create so many issues for yourself.”\nDavis refers to one of her post-series B clients as an example, which grew quickly, leading to a few initial communication bumps.\n“Our sales team was changing, because they were growing, and one of the sales managers was very upset,” she told Sifted. “They were planning to move offices and he was very agitated about this change. He said, ‘If we're doing this move, I'm not going to be able to yell across the table and get the designers to make changes and that's really inconvenient for me.’ I said to him: ‘Well, what happens when you scale internationally? How do you yell across the table when half the team is in New York?’”\nEven scaling from four to eight people or from eight to 16 — if you don't get the processes right early, you know you're going to create so many issues for yourself.\nDavis pushed the sales manager to keep the company’s future global ambitions in perspective. “I know it's easy to yell across,” she says. “But it's not a scalable process. So I challenged him to think about the alternative to that which is more inclusive of a global team.”\n2. Alienating employees in times of rapid change\nAt the beginning of a startup’s journey, early hires are often generalists who fill many roles. Then, as startups grow, they need to hire more specialists. But how do founders ensure their earliest hires still feel valued with all this change?\nQuinn says involving existing employees as much as possible in the hiring process has helped make early hires feel like stakeholders, boosting employee satisfaction and helping avoid employee churn.\nBrady echoes Quinn, and says involving Lightyear’s employees in the recruitment process has also helped them find the best talent, and hire people who are a great culture fit.\n“One of the biggest challenges for us was finding talent to fill the roles,” Brady says. Lightyear used recruiters with little luck. Brady learnt on the Advance: Scale Leaders programme that getting your current employees involved will find you better talent and reduce friction. “Using their techniques of getting everybody in the current team involved in the process, everybody engaged and everybody finding candidates has helped us a lot.”\n3. Founders fail when they get ‘stuck in the weeds’\nIn a high-growth company, things change extremely quickly. Scaling teams need someone to steer the ship in the right direction.\nAccording to Davis, mistakes are made when scaling leaders get stuck in small, technical issues and lose sight of the bigger picture.\n“A lot of founders and scaling leaders can sometimes get too stuck in the weeds, because it's comfortable there. There are some roles that a founder cannot delegate,” Davis says.\n“These are the three things I think founders should be focused on,” Davis continues. “Making sure you've got good investor relationships, making sure you understand what the customer needs are and making sure you're building your team. But if you're stuck in the nitty gritty, then no one's running that ship.”\nBrady agrees that properly delegating is key to overcoming a lot of scaling challenges which starts with trust.\nMaking sure you've got good investor relationships, making sure you understand what the customer needs are and making sure you're building your team.\n“You need to trust your team and your team needs to trust you,” Brady told Sifted.\n4. Keeping a sustainable workload\nKeeping sustainability in mind while rapidly scaling is a massive challenge. Davis told Sifted solutions that might not be taxing when you have two clients might be impossible when you have one hundred.\n“It’s important to think about the level of service you give your client and what you can maintain as sustainable for you as an individual. Can you sustain this way of life when the stakes are higher? There's more people that need you as a founder or leader –– how do you scale yourself as the business scales?” Davis asks.\nDaly says that caring about your employees’ and colleagues’ wellbeing and being a considerate employer is a key part of scaling a sustainable business. She says: “Being deliberate in embedding infrastructure around diversity, inclusion, wellbeing and making a positive impact as part of your core DNA is going to be key in managing some of the people-debt that you’ll likely face later down the road.”\nBeing deliberate in embedding infrastructure around diversity, inclusion, wellbeing and making a positive impact as part of your core DNA is going to be key in managing some of the people-debt that you’ll likely face later down the road.\nApply for Tech Nation’s Advance: Scaling Leaders Programme\nQuickly scaling businesses need all the help they can get.

    "content": "First of all, you gotta love the provocative title of this article from Roger Martin, ex-Dean of Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto here. Big. Lie. Hard to get past those two words. Big Lie.\nWhy is strategy (potentially) a scary thing?\nMartin starts by making the seemingly simple point that strategy is about the future. Okay, so far so good, I am tracking. . Then he proceeds to remind us that the future is unpredictable – oh, sheesh, Covid-19. That seems really true.\nSo, how do business executives respond to this uncertainty? Strategic planning.\nThe natural reaction is to make the challenge less daunting by turning it into a problem that can be solved with tried and tested tools. The plan is typically supported with detailed spreadsheets that project costs and revenue quite far into the future. By the end of the process, everyone feels a lot less scared. – Martin\nStrategic planning is common\nConfession time. Yes, I was a strategic planner. It’s on my Linkedin resume, and frankly, I am fairly proud of the work we did. Learned a lot about how the business was run, and surely, we were better off with an annual operating plan and budget than without one. Yes, strategic plans have a purpose. No, it is not strategy.\nWhat does strategic planning look like?\nWhile it might vary from company to company, it probably doesn’t. It’s a fairly formulaic process of macro (tops down) economic research on the business cycle, end-user demand, competitive dynamics, corporate initiatives and micro (bottom up) revenue forecasts from sales and cost estimates from finance. In simple terms, it’s your collective best guess of the next 12 months.\nThe intention is noble. Get all the facts and forecasts possible, then roll them into a longer-term plan from which to run the business. It serves a few purposes:\n- Allows the different business units to see each other’s plans\n- Coordinates corporate strategy (what the HQ was planning)\n- Creates budgets for capex, opex, recruiting\n- Sets revenue and profitability targets which drive executive bonuses\n- Finally, gives executives a sense of comfort and security about the future\nSounds good, what’s the problem?\n1. Surprisingly, not a lot of strategy\nLet’s start with the first step. Strategy is about creating a set of self-reinforcing activities which create a sustainable competitive advantage. It’s about creating massive value for your customers and getting some of that profit. Creating an economic moat. It’s about trade-offs. You can’t copy-cat your way to success.\nSome potential questions to ask:\n- What is our strategy? Can our employees articulate it?\n- What’s our strategic positioning vs. our top 3 rivals? Prove it.\n- What indicators do we track? What about leading indicators?\n- How well do we know our customers’ preferences? Are they changing?\n- Can a new entrant offer “less for less” and take our cheap customers?\n- What’s the worst thing that could happen with our supplier base?\n- What should we STOP doing?\nIf your strategic planning sessions have that kind of rigor, bravo. Usually, it’s not like that at all. Instead, it’s a little bit of kabuki theater where executives reiterate anecdotes about competitors and customers. Same ole, same ole.\n[The traditional approach] . . . is a truly terrible way to make strategy. It may be an excellent way to cope with fear of the unknown, but fear and discomfort are an essential part of strategy making. In fact, if you are entirely comfortable with your strategy, there’s a strong chance it isn’t very good. – Martin\nLet’s look at a oldie-goldie exercise, and how we might improve it. . .\nSWOT. Yes, I admit it. I’ve done it, so have you. 2×2 grid with Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, Threats. Sadly, it’s typically created ad-hoc during a workshop with limited rigor, and even less follow-through. There is very little push-back among the workshop participants. It’s more of a choir than an idea fight club.\nQuick tip: Try to dig-into the SWOT. . 1) what is the EBITDA implications of that threat/opportunity? 2) who’s the owner of that issue 3) How does that strength feed into our competitive advantage? Can we increase that? Is it an economic moat? 4) Weakness for whom? The entire corporation or a product line. 5) What are we deciding NOT TO DO?\nSo what does the unofficial process look like?\n2. Incremental: What did we do last year?\nIt’s just human nature that a business executive does not want to be wrong. We are all a little risk-averse. It’s easy (and a bit lazy) to build off of last year’s plan. Also, we tend to think that next year will look like this year (lots of heuristics).\n“Worse, actually choosing a strategy entails making decisions that explicitly cut off possibilities and options. An executive may well fear that getting those decisions wrong will wreck his or her career.” – Martin\nSo the default choice is to go through a series of excel-driven templates that build off of last year’s calcified assumptions. In defense of the thousands of companies that take this copy/paste + 3% approach to planning:\n- The organizational G/L and cost centers are set up like this\n- For a massively large corporation, how else do you plan to “herd the cats?”\n- Some industries (e.g., utilities, insurance) may be really steady\n- Pre-Covid 19, the US had stable economic conditions for 10+ years (interest rates low, inflation low, stock market positive); what could change?\n- Wall Street (unrealistically) expects good visibility and smooth earnings\nThese are all ingredients to a cake that looks like planning, not strategy.\n3. Sycophant: What’s the answer?\nWhen I was a strategic planner, I was 29-32 years old, and I did not step outside of my lane. In fact, I aggressively worked backwards from the answer I felt the executives wanted. It’s natural to “seek to please” the client or the executive. No shame there. However, it is also NOT strong opinions, loosely held.\nYes, strategists and management consultants are paid to help clients and executives to bridge cross-functional mess and get to yes. However, we should also build up enough expertise, relational equity, courage, and heart to push our CEO/CFO/CMO/COO to think a bit deeper, and act more bravely.\nKeep the strategy simple. Martin argues that strategy needs to focus on the customer (the ultimate arbiter of value) and ask two questions:\n- Where to compete (corporate strategy); which customers?\n- How to win (business unit strategy); how to create great value.\nThat’s what we should be asking, not “what’s the answer my boss/client wants.”\n4. Internal negotiations\nAsk anyone in charge of the strategic planning process (or for that matter – any company-wide, forecasting process), and they will tell you there are multiple rounds of internal negotiations on cost allocations, sales targets, and bonuses.\nToo often – definitely in my experience, the strategic planning process is less about winning in the market, and more about organizing the internal departments and “getting alignment.”\nSo what?\nAssigned this article to the strategy class for the first time, and the timing was eerily perfect. The global economy was systematically shut down and classes were moved to remote. Yes, the perfect plans in the syllabus were changed. In fact, every strategy group and strategic plan this year was 30-50% wrong.\nStrategy involves a bet\nRoger Martin is ex-Monitor, Michael Porter’s firm that got acquired by Deloitte. Martin argues that strategy is about placing a bet. It’s not about coming up with some perfect excel-model-Nirvana.\nAt its very best, therefore, strategy shortens the odds of a company’s bets. Managers must internalize that fact if they are not to be intimidated by the strategy-making process. Boards and regulators need to reinforce rather than undermine the notion that strategy involves a bet. – Martin\nStrategy is a portfolio of call options\nRead an article from Bain called, “Five Ways the Best Companies Close the Strategy-Execution Gap” here and it super resonated. The idea is that we live in a VUCA (volative, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) world, and of course, our strategy will be imperfect. It’s a strategy, not a plan, remember?\nSo if you think of it like “call options”, you can invest a little bit here, and there, and wait and see. If the strategy starts to bud – invest more. If it starts to die – reassess and be willing to cut bait, and de-fund the venture.\nDiscovery-driven strategic planning\nOn this topic, also a huge fan of Rita Gunter McGrath’s (Columbia) article entiteld Discovery Driven Strategic Planning here. Very similar to the Bain idea that instead of putting together a 300+ page PowerPoint that you don’t look at through out the year, why not simplify it and make it easy to refer to, and marginally fund the ideas that work. Test, test, test. Jim Collins would approve.\nWhat other thoughts do you have on strategic planning?",

And of course, we investigated who was getting rich…\nSo here they are — the most eyeballed articles on Sifted this year:\n1/ Revolut has turned over 70 employees into millionaires\nA maturing European tech ecosystem should mean more millionaires. Nowhere is this more true than at Revolut, Europe’s second most valuable private company.\nAt least 76 past and current employees now own shares in Revolut worth seven figures according to a Sifted analysis of Companies House records. Among them, over a dozen hold $10m+ worth of shares. That includes both long-time veterans like Alan Chang, who oversees operations at Revolut, as well as departed executives like Revolut’s first CFO, Peter O’Higgins.\n2/ 15 metaverse startups to watch according to investors and founders\n2021 was the year when the concept of the metaverse came into the vernacular thanks to Mark Zuckerberg — and VCs started piling in. European investors and founders shared with us 15 metaverse companies in Europe that they had their eyes on in countries from Iceland to Poland and France.\n3/ A beginner’s guide to the metaverse (and making money in it)\nSifted readers, you were really, really into the metaverse, weren’t you? Our deeptech guru Maija Palmer walked readers through the evolution of the metaverse from the birth of the word to 1992 to its use today to refer to a highly immersive, shared virtual world where people gather to play games, socialise and work.\n4/ Gorillas: The new WeWork?\nNo sector in European tech got more press and hype this year than speedy grocery. Among the most-well funded competitors is Berlin-based Gorillas, who handily broke the record for the fastest European tech company to ever achieve unicorn status in March.\nBut with fast growth inevitably comes growing pains, as Gorillas experienced this year. Sifted talked to nine people who have accused the company of arbitrary firings, exploitation of riders and warehouse workers, as well as a hostile environment at the HQ. Others have raised questions about the cash-burning business model. How will the story end?\n5/ Early investors in Deliveroo eye 60,000% return on their money\nAh, the luck of first ticket investors. Get in a rocketship tech company and the returns can be astronomical, as Deliveroo’s early investors experienced when the delivery company went public earlier this year. Though the market cap has stayed below the estimated valuation before the listing, it’s uncertain early investors like Index and Hoxton went home as happy as this article predicted.\n6/ Europe’s top 10 “unicorn universities”\nUniversity and graduate programmes are where strong friendships are forged — some of which become the basis for starting a company together. Sifted took a look at the universities in Europe whose alumni have produced the most $1bn companies.\n7/ Europe’s top 30 young venture capitalists\nAs Gen Z enters the workforce, they’re also making their mark on VC. We charted the top 30 young VCs across Europe at firms like Speedinvest and Heartcore Capital. Some youngsters like Harry Stebbings have even set up their own funds.\n8/ Early investors in UiPath on track to make a 220,000% return\nRomanian robotic process automation startup UiPath’s US listing was a triumph for European tech — and a wake-up call to VCs. Its $1.3bn IPO was proof that great European companies can be founded anywhere, and the investors who did their due diligence were, Sifted discovered, duly well-rewarded.\n9/ Salt breakthrough could halve the cost of storing solar energy\nSweden is undoubtedly Europe’s impact tech capital, boasting disruptive private energy companies like battery giant Northvolt and (a little bit smaller) Seaborg, a small next-generation nuclear startup.\nOne of the biggest difficulties with wind or solar energy is finding a good way to store it. If you want both heat and power — for a low price — there have been few good options. Seaborg has discovered an improved molten salt storage solution that’s cheaper and more efficient than current technology, and could be a gamechanger for energy storage.\n10/ Breakthrough: Quantum computers will soon fit in your phone\nA quantum computer small enough to sit on your desk — or be embedded in a satellite, car or even a mobile phone — is no longer a pipe dream. The first such machines are actually starting to be delivered to early customers, thanks to advances in qubits created using synthetic diamonds. The tech is being brought to market by startup Quantum Brilliance, which raised a nearly $10m seed funding round from a consortium of investors led by Main Sequence Ventures and the founders of QxBranch, the Australian quantum services company acquired by Rigetti.",

    "domain": "lollydaskal.com",
    "age": "1,523 days ago",
    "content": "Psychological safety is still a fairly new concept, but its importance is being reinforced by a growing body of research, and it’s something that leaders everywhere should be thinking about—whether their teams are working in person or online.\nIn a nutshell, psychological safety describes a state in which people feel free to ask for help, share ideas, seek feedback, admit mistakes, ask about what they don’t know, try new things, and voice their views.\nIn too many organizational cultures, people hold back from sharing their thoughts and opinions out of fear that they’ll be seen as uninformed or disruptive. They don’t want to take a chance on being ridiculed, disregarded, or punished with a negative performance appraisal or other career-damaging responses.\nResearch has shown that in the absence of such threats, team members are far more likely to bring their whole selves to work. They feel free to express their creativity, talents and skills without censoring or silencing themselves, and they know they can learn actively on the job instead of trying to pretend they know everything.\nHere are six simple steps toward creating a psychologically safe environment in your workplace:\nTreat people the way they want to be treated. Set the Golden Rule aside. Don’t treat others the way you would want to be treated but as they want to be treated. When you can see from your employees’ point of view, you’ll understand how to make sure they feel valued and understood.\nEncourage healthy conflict. Create conditions where respectful conflict is welcomed. Encouraging people to debate their ideas sharpens everyone’s thinking. Give serious consideration even to off-the-wall ideas, because one of them may someday prove to be invaluable.\nAllow all voices to be heard. Make sure everyone in the room knows they can speak their mind and express their thoughts. Encourage broad participation instead of the too-common situation where the same people tend to dominate every discussion.

    "age": "1,523 days ago",
    "content": "The common mistake many companies make is to start creating a bunch of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for their company. They begin with a burst of energy, gather together the team, and work on KPIs in a quarterly planning session. They ask, \"What do we need to measure in each department?\" This produces 18 to 25 KPIs, a couple for each key executive to work on. Convinced they have changed the company, they dash off excited to see what results they will generate in the upcoming quarter. They should ask,, \"How do I create a KPI that measures my team's performance?\" A quarter later, many are demoralized, and little progress has been made measuring these KPIs. They lose steam, and by the 3rd quarter, it's back to business as usual.\nI have seen this many times before... If this resonates with you or you are wincing, then please read on.\nThe problem is that they started with the wrong question. \"What do we need to measure in each department?\" or \"How do I create a KPI?\" They should ask, \"What business problem do I need to solve?\"\nHow To Create a KPI\n-\nWhat problem do I need to solve? Pick one for the company that is bugging you and impeding your progress.\n-\nHow do I measure progress? Use a leading indicator to measure where you are going, not where you have been.\n-\nWhat are the SMART Red-Yellow-Green success criteria to determine if the goal is on track?\n-\nWhat actions should I take to get it, Green, when it is off track?\n-\nWhat should I do when it's Red or Yellow? What action can I take from the measurement to improve it?\nStart with just 1 or 2 KPIs. The secret of success is not in the KPI. The secret of success is in the actions you take to move the KPI towards your goal, not in the measurement itself. Don't measure everything that moves; measure what you want. Rather than having 18-25 KPIs, just do 1 or 2. Focus on the actions, get value, succeed, and then pick a few more to focus on. Actually creating a repeatable and sustainable process, not doing an event. Write out your path of progress as you create a KPI dashboard that works for you and your team.\nIf you focus on a couple of KPIs each quarter, before you know it, you will have 8-10 KPIs that are action-oriented KPIs that really make an impact on your business.",

    "content": "Practicing strategy in an uncertain world\nA modern strategy that works will require leaders to learn new skills and apply new tools. Here’s a primer for a refreshed approach.\nA version of this article appeared in the Summer 2021 issue of strategy+business.\nKristian Ebbesen Fjelde and his team knew that the executive committee meeting scheduled in mid-2019 to discuss the future strategy of their company was more important than most. Equinor’s leadership had changed the company’s name in May 2018 from Statoil to signify its intention to make it a more diversified energy company and take a leading role in the long-term goal of transitioning out of fossil fuels. Equinor was Norway’s biggest energy producer, and its leaders understood that the structural shifts in the market necessitated a radical shift in the business that would require more than a simple rebranding. Instead of putting together a presentation, Fjelde decided to run a “strategic beliefs” card game. His team circulated 16 statements, each describing what might become a core belief of the company. They covered everything from the direction of commodity prices to the impacts of climate change. The executives were asked to reveal one of two cards — depicting a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down — as a reaction to the statements and explain how they reached that view.\nThere were significant differences of opinion, but after an intense discussion, the leadership team came to a consensus. The inclusive nature of the discussion, the use of a different kind of facilitating tool, and the understanding that the results were not window dressing but rather core corporate beliefs underscored the importance of the exercise: developing a strategy that worked.\nIn too many cases, strategic discussions are not this fruitful. Often they result in a set of goals, bullet points, or statements that masquerade as strategy, but they don’t set out the clear direction, distinctive positioning, and feasible plan you would expect. It’s no wonder that a 2018 survey conducted by Strategy&, PwC’s strategy consulting business, found that 65 percent of executives think their organization lacks a winning strategy.\nThat’s a damning statistic. Because it means that even people who lead company transformations aren’t confident that they are on the right path, though they probably were part of the discussion to set the direction. And today, the stakes are getting even higher. Organizations are facing a prolonged period of uncertainty, challenging economic conditions, seismic geopolitical shifts, climate change, and societal fragility.\nIn this context, “strategy is more important than ever, but in a different way than we’ve traditionally thought of it: the metaphorical leader on a horse with a sword who says, ‘follow me,’” says Rita Gunther McGrath, professor at Columbia Business School. Instead, strategy should be conceived, developed, and executed in a more inclusive, dynamic, creative, and experimental way.\nWhat does this mean in practice? Drawing from interviews with leading management thinkers, academics, and executives, I highlight three aspects of strategy that require more attention and skill: behaviors, frameworks, and tools. Pioneers have already gotten the message; others have an opportunity to catch up. But first, we need to understand what strategy is in the current context.\nModern strategy\nThe challenge is that the term strategy is often misunderstood. Ask somebody outside the strategy team what it means — let alone what the company’s strategy is — and you’ll often get a quizzical look. Too often, as Bill Fischer of MIT’s Sloan School of Management says, “strategy is the ex post rationalization of coherent tactics.” Playing to Win authors A.G. Lafley and Roger L. Martin describe strategy as “a set of choices about winning” or, more specifically, “an integrated set of choices that uniquely positions the firm in its industry so as to create sustainable advantage and superior value relative to the competition.”\nStrategy should bring clarity to the uniqueness, direction, and activities of an organization. It should certainly generate more than short-term profits. Vijay Govindarajan of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College says that “we need to restore purpose as a central tenet for strategy.” This, he argues, should result “in optimized profits and optimized value for various stakeholders.” Note the use of value and stakeholders — today’s successful strategy is not simply based on shareholder return. This raises the bar again for strategy; Julian Birkinshaw of the London Business School says it leads to “more complex trade-offs in a world of responsible capitalism.”\nStrategy also applies to different organizational constructs (enterprise, business unit, function) and comes in many forms (traditional, adaptive, visionary, inventive, etc.), according to the degree of organizational change, the process involved, the level of input from employees, the time frame, and the degree of disruption facing the organization. Amy Webb, founder of the U.S.-based Future Today Institute, makes a distinction between “tactical decisions (very near term), strategy (a few years [two to five] out), visioning (longer term), and systems-level disruption and evolution (very long term).” Strategy plays a key role in this continuum in resolving “the tension between that systems-level, macro change and the day-to-day tactical operations of a company.”\nWith these insights in mind, we can get back to the three aspects of strategy that should be strengthened: behaviors, frameworks, and tools.\nChange behaviors\nStrategy is a personal endeavor. Its success largely comes down to how it changes the way people think, feel, and act. These three actions can lead to better results.\nRefresh mindsets. The mindset of the leader — and strategist — is a critical aspect of the strategy process. Start with a presumption of maximizing human contribution to the organization rather than maximizing compliance to a set of rules, advises Gary Hamel, cofounder of the Management Lab. In practice, this means finding a way to encourage participation, discourse, and challenge; transparency (of status, challenges, metrics) is critical. Move away from the all-too-common approach of presenting yourself as an elite team seeking selective inputs and then broadcasting the strategy. Demonstrate “curiosity, empathy, the willingness to take in new information, the willingness to welcome new information…and be open to surprise,” says Columbia’s McGrath. Humility helps too. “It’s hard to learn if you believe you already know [something], and we’re hardwired to believe we already know,” says Amy Edmondson of Harvard Business School. She uses the example of a clinical director of an intensive care unit who encourages challenge through careful framing, using statements such as “I might miss something, so I need to hear from you.”\nThe transformation of Microsoft under Satya Nadella’s leadership is another case in point. He led the change from a “know-it-all” culture to a “learn-it-all” culture. The message: Look more widely and wisely at examples outside the industry norms, and challenge conventional wisdom and constraints. Create time for reflection, playful experimentation, and ongoing cycles of testing and adjusting.\nAdopt new roles. Leaders should guard against conceit, argues Hamel, given “there’s no small group of leaders at the top of any organization today that has the bandwidth, the imagination, and the foresight to develop a point of view about where the organization should go next.” Instead, says Joost Minnaar, cofounder of Dutch firm Corporate Rebels, which describes itself as a movement to make work fun, act as a “curator of the good ideas from the grass roots…and then as a user of their authority to spread these ideas across the organization.” He was referring to the success of this approach at Buurtzorg, a Dutch home care nursing organization. Buurtzorg generated impressive results (related to patient outcomes, customer and employee satisfaction, and costs) through an approach based on autonomous working, supported by a small central management team.\nWithout losing your strategic skill set, learn to become an architect at the center of a network of specialists. Show more interest in others, draw in expertise, and convene dialogues. In particular, embrace the highly valuable and often scarce expertise in AI and data analytics, urges Daniel Hulme, CEO of Satalia, a global AI company specializing in enterprise solutions to efficiency problems. In practice, this means having leaders involved earlier in the strategic process and asking more questions; in the case of AI, many CEOs are unsure what AI can actually do, so they are wary about using it as a management tool. Hulme spends a lot of his time explaining AI’s potential.\nBeing coached in this way doesn’t come naturally for those used to a directive or managerial approach. It takes “a leap of faith at the beginning as you don’t feel like you’re adding much value. But asking questions is very powerful,” says Herminia Ibarra of the London Business School. It can help to focus on “doing” to reinforce the learning through the type of innovation sprints pioneered in the Google Ventures five-day method of experimentation.\nFacilitate a new strategic dialogue. Open up the strategic dialogue beyond the executive committee. Engender more creativity, imagination, and buy-in with a new strategy by involving stakeholders of different backgrounds, expertise, and styles from the beginning. This approach also mitigates groupthink and conservatism by reducing bias, which in practice means that “people in power will be less likely to give you the benefit of the doubt if you’re different. And you respond to that by being more cautious,” says Ibarra. And, according to Columbia’s McGrath, “the answers to whatever your puzzle is may come from very unexpected places — it could be a person who normally doesn’t have access to power.”\nMake this a routine, not a special exercise. And communicate the strategy — and the need for change specifically — in a way that is positive and personal. Nokia, for example, crowdsourced ideas for its new strategy on a regular basis — splitting teams into different areas (understanding the unarticulated needs of customers, disruptions and trends, industry dogmas, capabilities to be leveraged or built). One CEO of a technology company regularly meets 20 young people, selected at random from the organization, for breakfast to hear their perspectives. Jos de Blok, founder of Buurtzorg, uses his blog to explain a strategic decision and then invites everybody to comment in an open platform.\nIn these dialogues, frame the challenge carefully, invite participation, listen attentively without interruption, ask open and incisive questions, and respond thoughtfully, especially when you hear a contrarian view. This creates the psychological safety required for people to say what they really think, and to share their best ideas. The result is honest, meaningful conversations that avoid the “theater” we often see.\nEdmondson used the example of a newly appointed CFO who had agreed to an acquisition, though he had reservations that he didn’t immediately share with his team. The deal was a flop. “I didn’t want to be the skunk at the picnic,” he said of his reticence in the postmortem. Edmondson calls this description “a classic example of holding the wrong frame. When you’re making a strategic decision, you’re not at a picnic. And when you have a dissenting view, you’re not a skunk. You’re a valued team member.”\nStructuring the dialogue is critical too, especially to mitigate cognitive biases. For example, you can use rungs on what is called a ladder of inference skillfully: Work from facts, interpretations, assumptions, conclusions, and beliefs to actions in a way that avoids the classic mistakes of generalizations or lazy judgments. And collate, and use, the best possible data from within and outside your organization to inform the strategy and monitor its impact.\nExtend strategic frameworks\nThere’s a plethora of strategic frameworks today that have evolved over the past 70 years to help businesses make decisions. Some have stood the test of time, but still could be refreshed for today’s world..\nBuild more foresight capability. If you believe COVID-19 will cause substantial economic aftershocks and prolonged uncertainty, invest in foresight capability, that is, the ability to sense, shape, and adapt to events. This means collating insight from within and outside the organization on current and near-term dynamics (e.g., customer behavior) as well as indicators of systemic (e.g., demographic and macroeconomic) changes. Then filter out the noise and decide what to address — on a spectrum of immediate changes to long-term investments. Few organizations do this in a formal way. They don’t, for example, have cross-functional meetings that help pick up signals from different areas of the business and from their ecosystems.\nStrategic foresight isn’t just a matter of making predictions; it’s about creating a state of readiness and knowing when to act. No one can predict the future, but you can ask questions, explore new avenues, and experiment as a way to avoid slipping into the trap of blind reliance on old models. Invest more time in learning from pioneers. For example, in 2006, U.S. food and beverage company PepsiCo began to pursue a strategy anchored in four aspects of sustainability: products, planet, people, and impact . Named Performance with a Purpose (PwP), this strategy meant satisfying multiple stakeholder interests and delivering strong results. And after the implementation of PwP, revenue grew by 80 percent in the following decade, PepsiCo stock outperformed its sector index and the S&P 500 Index, women held nearly 40 percent of management roles, and environmental impacts were reduced significantly.\nThough not statistically representative, this approach is far more likely to generate strategic insights than using “common” or “best” practices.\nMaster the linkage between exploitation and exploration. To create an “ambidextrous” organization, exploit existing capabilities and explore new opportunities, then make the link between the two activities. This is easier said than done. Often execution goes wrong because resources are not deployed to the strategic priorities; some capability is missing in portfolio management. Institutionalized budgets are negotiated every year, which creates unhelpful rigidity when situations change and companies need need to redeploy investments.\nAlex Osterwalder, cofounder of Switzerland-based Strategyzer, a business consultancy, says that “too often innovation activities are completely disconnected from [the overall] strategy.” Karolin Frankenberger of the University of St. Gallen says that there is a “focus on what needs to be separated, and how to give the entity autonomy. But the strategy is only likely to be successful if separation is combined with linking mechanisms.” In practice, these mechanisms include making decisions jointly, using shared resources, reassigning talent, and designing appropriate incentive structures.\nThe demise of conglomerate GE illustrates the consequences of investing too much in exploring the future (digital activities in particular) and not enough in managing the present; GE established a separate business unit, GE Digital, in 2015, spending billions on digital initiatives that didn’t pan out. Ping An, a Chinese financial-services group, was more prescient. It used the foresight it gained while researching new technology to make improvements to its existing businesses and at the same time developed new business models to serve other financial institutions.\nExplore ecosystems wisely. Industry boundaries are blurring as ecosystems — networks of companies that collaborate across industries to create new products or services — grow in importance. However, many leadership teams still think of industries as silos. This can limit the scope of their exploration.\nLeaders need to recognize that strategy in this world of ecosystems is different from strategy practiced in vertically integrated organizations operating in a single industry. Work through a number of critical questions, such as: Which ecosystems should we participate in, and on what terms? Which role should we play in the ecosystem (e.g., orchestrator, partner, complementor)? How able are we to step up to the demands of ecosystem “life”? The latter requires a belief in shared value creation (away from sole, proprietary activities), more transparency (to build trust between ecosystem partners), a greater degree of dynamism (to adjust for new information, or interactions with ecosystem partners), and an outward-facing culture (given the extent of dependencies). Ecosystem pioneers such as Google, Alibaba, and Amazon demonstrate these characteristics.\nPower up the tools\nFor too long there has been a “knowing–doing” gap, as Howard Yu of the IMD business school puts it, between what has been taught — or read — and what has been practiced. A lack of tools hasn’t helped close that gap.\nHarness the power of strategy software-as-a-service. Innovative tools and books, from companies such as Strategy Tools and Strategyzer, illustrate strategic concepts and frameworks using design skills. They also “gamify” the strategy process using techniques found in play environments. For example, they run simulations of strategic scenarios or situations that can make strategy feel more real and enriching for participants than working on a case study or listening to a presentation. Such tools should be used carefully, however. Though fun and engaging, they have to be integrated into the existing strategy process for them to work, says Christian Rangen, cofounder of Strategy Tools.\nIt’s not a new concept — the practice dates back almost 20 years to the work of Bart Victor in Serious Play — but adoption of these tools has increased as work has moved online and organizations have seen the power of strategy processes that are open and scalable. Such tools also give an opportunity for people to contribute who might have been crowded out by “big characters” in smaller or face-to-face sessions. A greater level of participation enables more coaching and encourages a higher-quality dialogue than the typical top-down strategy exercises. This, in turn, helps upskill the participants and means that collaborators in the strategy process have a shared language, which improves effectiveness. As the data from these exercises is captured, leaders have the opportunity to analyze and identify where causality is linked to decisions.\nView AI as a new teammate. AI has the potential to play a more prominent role in the strategy process. Though the concept of an integrated human and AI strategy machine also isn’t brand new, some of the applications it might perform are. AI can interrogate data (from within the company and from a third party) to uncover new relationships or correlations that can enrich the material available to strategic thinkers. At this stage, it’s unlikely to be the source of strategic recommendations, breakthrough ideas, or big-picture thinking. “It’s still very much left to the human being to do the exploration. It requires creativity, pulling lots of different data sources, luck, and so many things that machines don’t have access to,” says Satalia’s Hulme.\nPioneers — corporate organizations, consultancies, and investors — are already using AI in a number of areas of strategy development and execution. For example:\n• Generating intelligence on the impact of external events or changes in sentiment on the organization.\n• Analyzing patterns of customer behavior. OakNorth, a U.K.-based fintech, uses AI in loan applications and in the analysis of credit data, which then feeds into strategic scenarios.\n• Optimizing expenditure and resource allocation, for example, in pharmaceutical R&D, customer churn, and sales and marketing.\n• Running simulations and scenarios. A team at Salesforce, a U.S. enterprise software company, has developed a system called AI Economist to identify optimal tax strategies for an economy’s tax code using sophisticated simulations.\n• Originating new commercial opportunities, for example, acquisition targets. CB Insights, an AI startup, provides this functionality as a service, and IBMPDF has used it for its own portfolio of investments.\n• Making predictions. Netflix, for example, uses AI to help it decide what new programs to make.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic might just be a catalyst for refreshing the way strategy is practiced. It will require upskilling and a willingness to experiment.\nThink of AI as a new teammate. Keith Strier, vice president of worldwide AI initiatives at Nvidia, a U.S. company specializing in visual computing technologies, argues that “it’s not that AI should replace strategists, or that [AI] will come up with things that [strategists] couldn’t think of…but the frontier of strategy involves intelligent humans and smart machines coming together to create new strategies.” AI is not a substitute for careful thought and strategic dialogue. Upskill your understanding and application of AI to take advantage of what is on offer. Not enough people involved in strategy have. It would be difficult “to find more than 10 percent of the Fortune 500 doing anything I would describe as material, meaningful AI,” says Strier.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic might just be a catalyst for refreshing the way strategy is practiced. It will require upskilling and a willingness to experiment, as demonstrated by Equinor’s Fjelde with his strategic beliefs card game. The next generation of leaders — and strategists — will certainly need to be more inclusive, curious, humble, and dynamic, and must have a greater appreciation of the potential (and limitations) of technology and ecosystems.\nAuthor profile:\n- David Lancefield is a strategist and coach who has advised more than 35 CEOs and has led 15 digital transformations.

    "content": "On What We Learned This Year: The 8 Habits Of Highly Progressive Workplaces\nBucket List Overview Today is the last day of what was a very exciting year; we grew the team at Corporate Rebels, launched the concept of Rebel Events, started to write our very own book and -as the cherry on the cake- were nominated for the Thinkers50 Breakthrough Idea Award!\nBut that’s not all. This year we visited once again many of our Bucket-list heroes, all around the globe. We learned lots and shared, earlier this month, our thoughts on the trends of highly progressive workplaces in the Italian magazine Maize. This is what we told them:\nThe Origin\n“We are not going to do this for another 40 years!” is what we told each other in the summer of 2015. Only two years into our engineering jobs we were completely frustrated with the old-fashioned organization structures of our employers. We were tired of the endless bureaucracy, the pointless report writing, and the lack of freedom and entrepreneurship. “There has to be a better way”, we said. We were convinced of that!\nWe did not, however, have any clue as to what ‘alternative’ workplaces would look like. So, we quit our jobs and set out to find answers. We had lots of questions, but one big aim: How to make work more fun.\nAs the Corporate Rebels, we have now traveled the globe for 2 years. We’ve learned from the most progressive organizations we could find. The results? We have ticked off 65+ ‘items’ on the ‘Bucket List’ we built. It now includes over 100+ workplace pioneers, entrepreneurs, academics, organizations and leaders—each of whom has succeeded by working in radically different ways.\nPerhaps you are now thinking of names like Patagonia, Semco, Spotify and Haier. And yes, we’ve visited many of these. But we are also intrigued by the unknown stories. We discovered they can be even more inspiring.\n“But what makes those utopian-sounding workplaces really different to my own?” you might ask us. This is not an easy question to answer. But we now think we have identified 8 habits which clearly distinguish the truly progressive organizations from the others. Here they are:\n1 From profit to purpose & values\nProgressive organizations no longer focus solely on increasing shareholder value. They focus on building a workplace around common purpose and values. Because having purpose and meaning gives people the energy, passion and motivation to get out of bed in the morning.\nIt also fosters communities of like-minded employees, customers, suppliers and others. They come together with shared ideals. As a result, inspiring work cuts through bureaucracies, silos, and egos to unleash the potential of an organization.\nTo be clear: we are not talking about a mission statement full of pretentious banalities (or what Americans call corporate bullshit). We are talking about crisp and clear causes that activate people inside and outside the organization. This purpose should be translated into organization, team and individual goals—to ensure everyone is aligned.\nAlong with clarity of mission come values, behaviours and skills that are shared by colleagues. Values are multifunctional within a business. They are not prescribed rules, but guidelines to speed decision-making, and not hiring based on skills (only), but also hiring for culture. Skills can be trained.\n2. From hierarchical pyramids to networks of teams\nProgressive organizations know the familiar pyramid is out-dated. It simply does not fit with today’s quickly changing environment. The rigidity of command-and-control does not promote agility, speed, and engagement.\nThis is why we find progressive organizations tend to adopt alternative structures. Typically, they turn the rigid pyramid into an agile network of teams. Teams are often organized as networks of up to 15 people. They may be multidisciplinary. They are responsible for their own results. They are connected as needed to other networks to form networks of networks.\nEach team has skin in the game. They feel the impact of their (financial) successes and failures. This increases responsibility, entrepreneurship, communication, adaptability and the willingness to support each other. The rigid organization belongs in the graveyard.\n3. From directive to supportive leadership\nMost command-and-control structures operate with a directive leadership style. Team leaders, supervisors, managers, vice presidents and directors ‘direct’ their subordinates. This form of leadership is based on fear, control, and telling others what and how to do their job. It tends to neglect the wisdom of the crowd. It disengages those lower down in the organization.\nWithin progressive organizations, we see another type of leadership: strong leaders who are supportive of those ‘closest to the fire'. They constantly challenge the status quo - the way we've always done things - and encourage the entire organization to do the same.\nThese leaders walk the talk. They embody organization mission and values. They are crucial to an organization's culture. They do everything in their power to remove barriers. They help their employees thrive. Authority is no longer linked to rank, but rather to the ability to lead by example.\n4. From plan & predict to experiment & adapt\nPlan and predict is a fundamental tenet of traditional management in which yearly budgeting, resource allocation, and plans are all cascaded down the organization chart.\nBut they are based on the false belief that we can (still) predict the future. The new reality is, that as the environment gets more complex, it’s impossible to make precise predictions. Adaptability is now much more important. Progressive organizations abandon guesses masquerading as precise predictions. They focus on experimentation instead.\nAnd they embrace experimentation in everything they do: products, ways of working, and even structures. Change is no longer a once-in-a-year event. It’s a part of every-day work. The adaptive organizations we’ve studied believe it’s better to experiment and fail than to never make mistakes at all.\n5. From rules & control to freedom & trust\nOne could argue that traditional organizations have such bureaucracy in place that ensures employees neatly follow the rules. It can be tempting to formulate a policy for what might happen. It ends up trying to predict and control the outcomes of what people do.\nMore and more, this bureaucracy becomes a barrier to engagement and success. It hinders autonomy, innovation and creativity. Thus it becomes a liability for the organization.\nProgressive organizations, on the contrary, act on the belief that employees are responsible adults who can be trusted. They don't need extensive control. They perform best when given a high degree of autonomy. They can be trusted to do their job in the way they see fit. They let employees decide where, when and with whom to work.\n6. From centralized authority to distributed decision making\nAn important feature of the traditional organization is centralization. This suggests that decision-making competence rises with the position in the hierarchy. This is obviously nonsense.\nProgressive organizations tend to be highly decentralized. They act on the belief that employees on the frontline have the best understanding of customers, suppliers, and production machines. Therefore, frontline employees should make the majority of the decisions—if the aim is to be agile in responding to clients.\nIn progressive organizations, we see distributed authority and decision-making. But don’t be fooled. With freedom of decision making comes responsibility and accountability.\n7. From secrecy to radical transparency\nTraditional organizations tend to limit valuable information only to the leaders. They, then, must call all the important shots. To be able to distribute authority to frontline employees requires a culture of radical transparency.\nFrontline employees need access to the latest information for speedy and accurate decision-making. Progressive organizations thrive when they are ‘open by default’. This policy turns radical transparency into a valuable tool. It fosters an ‘ask anything’ mentality. It requires more trust from both team members and leaders.\nTo make this a success, progressive organizations grant company-wide access to data, documents, financials—in real-time. They give people the right information at the right moment. This means better decisions, faster, and problems solved sooner. It promotes collaboration in and outside the organization.\n8. From job descriptions to talents & mastery\nTraditional organizations tend to distribute activities based on job titles and descriptions. But many of these are out-of-date the moment they are crafted.\nThis old habit forces people to work on things they are supposed to do, but not necessarily disposed to do. People prefer working on tasks they like; ones that fit their talents and strengths. We know that doing what you are good at increases motivation and engagement.\nProgressive organizations leverage this dynamic. They try to make use of the diverse talents present in the whole organization. They offer people the freedom to choose their tasks and responsibilities. In progressive organizations, employees ‘sculpt’ their jobs based on their interest, talents and strengths. Often, a ‘work of art’ results!\nThe Disclaimer\nPlease be aware. This list is not a blueprint for success, nor a ‘box-ticking’ exercise. Please use it carefully—solely for inspiration. And please note: we haven’t visited yet, in 2 years, any workplace that has fully developed all these 8 points.\nThere is a good reason for this. Most inspiring workplaces find a unique way to success. While these ways are different for every single workplace, the mindset is not. It is this particular mindset that sets them apart from the crowd. We summarize it in three simple points:\nListen to your employees. The most progressive organizations have leaders who truly listen. They constantly ask employees: “What do you want? What support do you need to be able to perform better?” They use the 8 trends as inspiration for proper dialogue; to ensure all are heard, and then they act. The key is doing everything they can to implement the suggestions—thereby giving respect to their employees.\nSearch for inspiration. The most progressive organizations understand that they rarely need to re-invent the wheel. They know it has probably been done before. So, when they encounter an opportunity, a challenge, or a problem, they start a search. They search both inside and outside their organization. They know others may have faced a similar issue, and found a good solution.\nConduct experiments. Arguably the most important thing about progressive organizations is that they ‘just do it’. Because it’s only with constant experimentation that they move on. And when this is done well, we see that radical ways of working in the workplace are rarely more than a combination of outside inspiration, gut feeling and common sense—all acted on.\nEndings and beginnings...\n2017 has been truly amazing and has been an important period in growing the worldwide movement to make work more fun. We've met thousands of like-minded people who are just as eager to make a significant impact on building better workplaces.\nWe're very thankful for that and once again want to thank all of you for your commitment, action, and support. It means a lot to us and it sure as hell means a lot to all the people working in uninspiring, dreadful workplaces.\nIn a few hours, at the dawn of the new year, it's time to celebrate the start of 2018 and toast to all the good things it will bring along. Together with you, we toast to a new year in which we will jointly grow our impact to make work more fun. See you in 2018!",

    "content": "As a company grows and evolves, a founder’s leadership style must evolve alongside it. The behaviours that make a great founder at the startup phase do not always scale well.\nOne key step a founder of a scaleup must make is shifting from being the performer to being the coach. There was a lot of noise when Netflix released Michael Jordan’s documentary The Last Dance, and many founders shared how much they related to Jordan’s approach, but too few recognised the power of Phil Jackson, the coach of the Bulls at the time.\nAs a founder grows their leadership team, they must learn to create the environment for a high-performing team, not just role model it. The inability to do this well can be the end of a founder’s ability to lead their company as CEO.\nSo, how can you be more Phil?\nStart early, start small\nThe validation and energy we get from building something from nothing is addictive, but we have to make sure we check ourselves out of that process. Founders that see validation from working in the business and not on the business can unintentionally stagnate growth by not enabling their teams to have autonomy.\nAs a founder, recognise your own limitations and delegate quickly and early. Sure, at seed stage it’s all hands on deck, but as we move into Series A+, you should have key players around you to shoulder the growth. For starters, double down on where you know you will win and hire around you to build up a dynamic team that plays well together. Hiring executives can be challenging, but developing them is a whole other ballgame.\nBe open with your team that you are intentionally making the shift and what you expect of them and what they should expect from you. This transition is a team effort, so make sure you seek feedback to validate your progress.\nYou are there to make sure the work gets done, not to do the work.\nAs a leader of a high-performing team, you want to be able to understand the skill set each player brings to the court and ensure you’re creating the space for them to thrive. You are there to make sure the work gets done, not to do the work.\nBut this doesn’t mean giving them full rein; I have often witnessed founders giving away too much power to over-eager experienced execs who haven’t fully got to grips with your product, culture and clients. Founders then have to sort out the damage later on.\nWhere to start?\n- Start by listing out everything on your plate including both things to do (now) and things you’d like to do (later)\n- Go through each one and highlight the ones that only you — as a founder — can do and can’t be outsourced to a team member (ie. raising money, board relationships, press)\n- For everything left, highlight who on your team could support you in either taking ownership of it with your guidance, or take responsibility for part of it\nImagine the goal is to eradicate you from the operations of the business. This is the growth mindset that enables you to let go of things early, hire smart and coach your team to their full collective potential.\nImagine the goal is to eradicate you from the operations of the business.\nLeadership is about setting clear expectations and company culture, calling out bad behaviours like; how they treat their team, when they underdeliver on expectations, or even how they talk to you, early and often so that your leadership team should be clear on what it means to lead at your company. Be firm on what kind of company culture you are committed to building and have a set of values (behaviours that drive your strategy) at hand as a reference point.\nThe space to lead\nStaying on top of our self-awareness takes time so I often recommend founders block out a weekly hour, at minimum, to check-in on their leadership approach to developing their teams.\nAsk yourself:\n- What signals are my team telling me that I’m doing things right?\n- Have I received any direct/indirect feedback that I’ve rejected; what could I learn from that situation?\n- What would I have done differently last week?\n- What growth opportunities do I see for my team members in the coming quarter/year that would align with their potential and capabilities?\n- What leader do I want to be and which behaviours do I need to role model?\n- What does each team member need from me right now?\nUnfortunately, there’s no silver bullet or purchasable playbook to leadership. Consistent leadership is about adapting our approach to each of our players in any given situation. And to do that well, you have to understand everybody’s individual motivations and triggers. Get to know your team by asking about their communication preferences, observe how they respond to challenges and know why they are working for you over anywhere else.\nGood leadership also means staying out of the details so you have the headspace to look ahead.\nAt this stage, good leadership also means staying out of the details so you have the headspace to look ahead.\nToo often, I have had leaders share their discomfort when they have “nothing to do” i.e. their teams are getting shit done. That’s exactly how things should be, because that’s when real strategy happens: the space to create connections, set priorities, look for partnerships and stretch their teams by supporting ‘not doing’.\nBuild a team, not several silos\nLet’s be clear, a high-performing team is not a group of high performers. You can’t throw smart people into a team and expect them to operate effectively.\nYour role as a leader is to help build cohesive team dynamics by enabling them to work better together. This means helping them to solve their own problems together, instead of being the go-between. Keep energy and confidence up by celebrating small victories and recognising good behaviours.\nAvoid creating silos.\nYour team is collectively responsible for the business performance so avoid creating silos in your goal setting. The leadership team should be working together as one, and your role as a founder is to ensure they are actively supporting each other, not working against each other:\n- Set leadership team OKRs that are a company focus instead of departmental — i.e. every leader is responsible for diversity and inclusion OKRs, not just HR. This helps breed the priorities of your business in each employee.\n- If team members come to you with challenges they are having with other departments, don’t listen; instead coach them to give that feedback to their peers directly and not through you. If necessary, join as a mediator.\n- Recognise small wins weekly and call that out in front of your leadership team to instil confidence and commitment.\nGoogle has done tonnes of research on psychological safety and its studies prove how teams that work better together drive up revenue. As a team, you should feel comfortable arguing and feel safe admitting mistakes. The easiest and cheapest way to start is to role model. Acknowledge to your leadership team when you’ve mucked up and what you’ve learned in the process. Encourage them to do the same by asking in your team meetings, ‘Who’s got a fuck-up to share and what can we learn from it.’\nTake the discomfort out of failure by bringing it to the open because if we can’t talk about it we can't address it.\nI’ve worked with countless teams who — direct quote — “like each other too much to disagree,” driving dissent outside of the room where it matters most. I’ve also worked with teams who love to argue but can never make any progress in committing to a course of action.\nAn aligned team signals confidence in your employees, an underrated metric in times of uncertainty, therefore communicating as ‘one team’ is key, especially in remote settings when we can’t catch misunderstandings quickly. Take the time necessary to get your team aligned and working off the same page; this can look like creating a collaborative document with FAQs about strategy, processes and responsibilities to tease out any misunderstandings.\nRoundup\nLeading a strong team is a key business imperative; Apple’s CEO Tim Cook said his team’s strength, as a team, in part led to stronger than expected business performance in 2020.\nAs a founder growing your leadership team, your focus should be to bring teams together through providing clarity, alignment and focus, whilst maintaining pace and resilience. This is a skill that many founders have to learn as they evolve in their journey. What makes a great individual performer doesn’t necessarily translate to being a great team coach.\nJordan’s story is no doubt inspiring, but for founders that recognise they need to start playing coach, I’d recommend digging into Jackson’s book, In Sacred Hoops: Spiritual Lessons of a Hardwood Warrior. Or, for the short of time, remember this quote from The Jungle Book that it opens with: “The pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack.”",

Outcomes measure if solutions meet business and customer needs using KPIs, OKRs, and employee engagement metrics. Flow metrics assess delivery efficiency and predictability, including flow distribution, velocity, time, load, efficiency, and predictability. Assessments measure proficiency in SAFe Disciplines and practices.\nEffective measurement requires using metrics with other discovery methods, focusing on metrics that drive decision-making, understanding how metrics impact behavior, and interpreting metrics carefully. By measuring these domains and adhering to best practices, organizations can improve their business agility and achieve better outcomes.\nWhat is meant by measure and grow in SAFe?\nWhen it comes to metrics, the first and most important thing is understanding what to measure. The goal of Business Agility is clear: quickly respond to market changes and emerging opportunities with innovative, digitally-enabled business solutions. The Business Agility Value Stream, shown in Figure 1, visualizes the steps needed to achieve this. SAFe’s three measurement domains, Outcomes, Flow, and Competency, support this process and provide a comprehensive yet simple model for measuring progress toward this goal. The insights provided by these three measurement domains support better decision-making and help to identify opportunities for improvement.\nThe three measurement domains are defined as follows:\n- Outcomes: Do our solutions meet the needs of our customers and the business?\n- Flow: How efficient is the organization at delivering value to the customer?\n- Competency: How proficient is the organization in the practices that enable agility?\nThese three measurement domains apply at every level of an organization. As Figure 2 illustrates, they can be used to measure performance within a SAFe portfolio, a Solution Train, an Agile Release Train (ART), or even a single Agile Team.\nEach measurement domain contains a set of specific metrics, which are described in the sections below.\nRead more about the Business Agility Value Stream:\nLast Update: 8 September 2025",

We appreciate your interest.\nPromoting psychological safety has become challenging for remote teams, but there are many ways to create a safe virtual space.\nBy Gustavo Razzetti\nFebruary 3, 2021\nRemote work is here to stay. As most teams continue to work from home – either by chance or design – communication, collaboration, and interpersonal relationships take a toll. Virtual practices undermine psychological safety, requiring teams to pay attention to how to (re)build collective trust.\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, organizations were worried about productivity and making sure people were actually working (from home). However, taking care of the technology and process side of remote work was just the beginning – building a thriving remote culture will make or break most teams.\nThe good news is that virtual environments have as many opportunities to build stronger teams as they do challenges.\nIn this article, I will share actionable steps and methods to promote psychological safety in remote teams based on our work leading hundreds of virtual team sessions.\nPsychologically safe team members feel confident to speak up, admit they don’t know something, share their ideas, ask questions, be themselves, and even challenge their managers – all without the fear of being ignored, judged, or punished. Psychological safety is the secret to high-performing teams, according to Google research.\nPsychological safety is similar to, but not the same as trust. While the latter happens between two people, the former is something that the team provides. Everyone contributes to building a safe environment – it’s not something that a manager can provide.\nPromoting an environment of psychological safety is easier said than done. In the context of hybrid or fully remote teams, it’s even more challenging. Building strong interpersonal relationships has become more difficult without room for impromptu encounters. Cues are challenging to read when people are not in the same room.\nI've written several pieces on building psychological safety and specific exercises to promote it at work.\nFollowing, you will find simple and actionable tactics and methods to start implementing right away – some are simpler than others. I've categorized them in the most critical issues affecting remote teams: increasing participation, dealing with silence, building interpersonal relationships, promoting courageous conversations, and other areas.\nConversational turn-taking: Give each person equal airtime; avoid letting just a few control the conversation. The facilitator protects the introverts from the extroverts by keeping loud, dominant voices for last.\nPass it on: Similar to the previous, but facilitated by team members. After one person responds to a prompt or question, they choose who goes next until everyone has had their turn. This technique increases awareness, making people more mindful about who has or hasn’t participated in a team activity.\nSeed Volunteers: It takes a spark to start a fire. If your team is suffering from the ‘no one wants to be the first to talk issue, seeding a volunteer will help you break that pattern. Look for team members willing to step up and model the right behavior. Someone has to pave the road; find the right advocate.\nCoach Leaders to Being Challenged: Building on the above, it’s hard for people to be candid when the rules don’t apply to their leaders. Preparing leaders to embrace their vulnerability is crucial to building psychological safety. People need to see that their managers are willing to take risks before they can take the leap, too. Leaders must be coached to learn how to listen and avoid reacting when people start sharing sensitive things – body language is even more critical in a Zoom call where facial gestures are more evident.\nMake It Easy to Ask Anything: Encourage your team members to ask questions, even silly ones, in Slack. Make sure someone will address those without judgment. This will reinforce that it’s okay to ask anything, creating a virtual culture that helps each other.\nPolls: I’m not a fan of anonymous practices, but polls are great for getting quick feedback on how people feel about a topic without making it personal. It encourages immediate participation in little time. Use thought-provoking questions that encourage reflection.\nBreakout Rooms: Smaller groups feel safer, providing a natural space for deep conversations or brainstorming. Divide people into smaller groups of 5-7 team members to work on similar challenges. You benefit from different perspectives, but when it comes to sharing with the larger team, people feel more confident talking about something that has already been discussed with their peers.\nThere are two types of silence: reflective or detached. The first is when someone opts to stay silent to pay attention to others, to think before speaking, or to wait for a safe moment to express their thoughts. The latter is when people don’t talk because they are either too afraid or have stopped caring.\nBoth types of silence are interconnected. If we don’t provide the right conditions to shift from reflection to action, people can quickly fall into a pattern of detachment.\nAccept silence: It’s okay if no one has anything to say, or people are in reflective mode. Embrace silence as something beautiful. Avoid the urge to jump into a conversation just to fill up space.\nBe patient: Silence could be the beginning of something else. Don’t rush through it. If someone stopped talking, don’t complete their sentences or push them. Don’t interrupt people when they are thinking. Breaking silences sometimes requires more silence.\nAddress silence collectively: Rather than making it about those who are not talking, shift the conversation. What does silence says about how we're doing as a team? What are the things that we aren't talking about and which need to be addressed?\nMake outliers feel welcome: Teams tend to default to the lowest common denominator. It makes it difficult for an outlier to speak out, as no one wants to be seen as the oddity. Every team member is a sensor; welcome those who see what most don’t.\nExplicit the implicit: Avoiding conflict feels easy, but it’s an unhealthy practice. What happens in the watercooler conversation is not discussed in the open. Invite people to make explicit what everybody is thinking, but no one is saying.\nReward participation from quiet people: When people participate more than usual, show them appreciation. If they post a question on Slack, use emojis to acknowledge your attention.\nSilent Meetings: Ask for input from each member individually ahead of the session. Alternatively, provide time before the meeting starts to reflect and capture everyone’s thoughts before sharing them out loud with the group.\nGetting to know your team members increases heart trust (the idea that you believe people will have your interest at heart).\nBuilding strong relationships requires getting more personal with your coworkers, but it shouldn’t be limited to fun team-building activities. Rituals help build strong virtual teams.\nCode of Conduct: Culture is the behavior we reward and punish. Successful teams establish clear rules that define what’s okay and what’s not okay within the group. Start by building a safe space agreement. Clarify desired mindsets and behaviors, including respect, confidentiality, and other topics.\nKryptonite and Superpower: A team is a collection of everyone’s personalities, perspectives, skills, experiences, and powers. Invite each team member to share their superpower (the unique strength that makes them powerful) and kryptonite (what paralyzes or hinders their abilities).\nAddress Individual Working Styles: People’s personalities and working styles shape their preferences, especially in remote environments. Use the following questions and prompts to better understand your colleagues:\n“I’m good at…”\n“What’s your preferred communication method?”\n“Early riser or night owl?”\n“Talk to think or think to talk?”\n“I get angry when…”\n“When I get pissed off, I…”\nBuild a Team Map: When we start working with a new team, we love to create a visual team map in MURAL that captures the keys aspects of each team member. Start with the basics: name, personal picture, title, etc. but don’t stop there. Ask people to share a photo that captures one of their most important moments in life.\nOf course, include people’s Superpowers and Kryptonite as well as their answers related to their personal workstyle. Also, “The best thing about being me…” and “Where do you go when you want to recharge yourself” will not only reveal surprising sides of your coworkers but also build more profound empathy.\nUpdate your map with new hires and use it to help them familiarize themselves with their colleagues.\nCelebrate Diverse Perspectives: Being the challenging voice is intimidating – people worry they will be labeled as negative. Successful teams benefit from multiple voices; diversity of thought, not groupthink, drives innovation. Encourage team members to play such roles as outsider, devil’s advocate, analyst, etc. Roles should rotate to help practice people.\nCollective wisdom requires combining everyone’s view; problems change when we switch from a 2D to a 3D perspective, as well as vice versa.\nThe purpose of increasing psychological safety is to make remote team members feel safe and encourage courageous conversations. You want your team to address pressing issues or uncover new solutions.\nBeef Time: This one is inspired by Slack’s “Beef Tweets” channel, where employees share everything in the open – especially issues with its own product. This not only makes it safe for people to speak up, but it also encourages colleagues to offer to help.\nWe introduced the idea of Beef-Time to some clients. During that time, people are allowed to vent in the open without fear of retaliation. Everyone must listen without reacting or judging. At the end of the session, everyone proposes solutions to eliminate the frustrations and issues that were made public.\nVoice of the Employee: Raising issues individually is hard, but it feels easier when everyone is in it together. Zappos implemented the Voice of Employee (VOE), a bi-weekly meeting to uncover and address tensions across the organization.\nThe Voice of Employee is not an HR committee but an open space that allows randomly selected representatives from all departments to get together to “bubble up and bubble down concerns, feedback, and ideas.” The group ensures that courageous conversations happen by sharing uncovered issues with the company leadership.\nBlameless Postmortems: This exercise, practiced by Etsy, Atlassian, and Google, helps shift the conversation from “Who’s going to be fired?” to “How can we improve as a team?” Rather than finding the culprit, this type of postmortem focuses on improving the system – the team culture.\nA Blameless Postmortem is not about removing accountability. On the contrary, it encourages people to have tough conversations, identify errors, and take ownership of improving their operating system.\nFollow these guidelines to facilitate a blameless postmortem.\nUncover the Stinky Fish: The issues that affect your team won’t go away just because you don’t address them – they will worsen over time. The Stinky Fish is a metaphor for the problems that start to smell and soon contaminate everything.\nWe use this tool to help teams address the issues they can’t get over, problems that are increasing anxiety, or what everybody’s thinking but no one is saying. People love getting their stinky fish out of the system. However, driving open and productive conversations requires not only the Stinky Fish Canvas, but also proper facilitation.\nSuccessful organizations realize the power of random interactions to solve problems or foster innovation. Apple’s restrooms are inconveniently located so people have to walk more and, hopefully, meet people they would never run into. Zappos designed its lobby for impromptu collisions. IKEA’s offices have a central staircase for employees to hang out and have short talks with their colleagues.\nRecreating those random collisions in a virtual environment is critical to both drive innovation and build strong relationships. Have a dedicated Zoom channel that people can join at any time and see who’s there. Encourage people to invite colleagues for a virtual coffee or peer learning groups using Starmeup or Donut. Recreate the “Bring your kids/ pets to work,” but virtually, fostering camaraderie.\nCreate a collaborative playlist on Spotify and have each team member contribute with one song. Make it meaningful by finding a theme. It can be a song that represents what everyone brings to the team, or just their favorite tune. You can create various team-inspired playlists for different occasions, like “music for brainstorming”, “songs for deep work and concentration”, or “songs to celebrate quick-wins.”\nThis has been a recurring theme among most of the teams I coached during 2020. Managing the demands of remote work, plus the pandemic and homeschooling, have drained most teams’ energy – especially in controlling environments or managers.\nEncourage no-meetings days or hours, like Assana’s no-meeting Wednesdays or how Patagonia has blocked everyone’s calendar from noon to 1 PM.\nAdd breaks in between meetings to give people time to breathe, take bio breaks, or just to prepare for what’s next.\nMonitor your team’s energy level regularly. Use emojis on your Slack channel to track how people are feeling. Alternatively, run a simple color-coded weekly assessment to monitor workload: Green is good, Yellow is not so good, and Red means people are overloaded.\nIKEA’s founder believed that only those who are sleeping don’t make errors. Mistake tolerance doesn’t mean lowering the bar but understanding that mistakes are stepping stones rather than the end of the world.\nPeople learn by experimenting and making mistakes while trying something for the first time. Mistake tolerance means innovating with a learning mindset, not a blaming one.\nAddressing mistakes in the open prevents other people from repeating the same mistakes. Attend a F@ck-Up night event or invite your team to host a Church of Fail session. Leaders should address their mistakes in front of others first, encouraging others to follow their example.\nTraditionally, most one-on-one talks were used for grievance purposes. Turn 1:1s into coaching sessions; ask questions and listen to what’s going on before jumping to conclusions. If an issue involves another person, facilitate a chat between those involved to help them express their tensions constructively.\nAgility and innovation depend on experimentation and diversity of thought. To get the best out of your team members, people must feel that everyone has each other’s back.\nPromoting psychological safety isn't an easy task, but there are many opportunities to test new methods in virtual environments.\nNow more than ever, organizations need a leader with the integrity to tell the truth, the vulnerability to say “I don’t know”, the courage to accept being challenged by others, and the guts to act fearlessly.\nDo you need help building psychological safety in your remote team?

    "title": "What Is An Activity System Map?",
    "domain": "strategictoolkits.com",

    "content": "Michael Porter introduced the idea of an activity system map in 1985 as a way to strengthen business strategy.\nIt serves as a visual tool that shows how different activities connect, support each other, and build on a company’s core strengths.\nBy mapping these links, organizations can see how their efforts fit together, making it easier to stay focused on long-term goals and create a stronger competitive position.\nThe Primary Value of an Activity System Map\nAn activity system map gives clarity to how different parts of an organization connect. Instead of viewing activities in isolation, the map highlights the full web of relationships.\nManagers can see how each function, policy, and process contributes to the company’s broader strategy. That perspective turns scattered efforts into a coordinated system.\nWhen leaders apply this approach, they can identify strengths, notice weak links, and align every decision with long-term objectives. The activity system map serves both as a guide and a tool for analysis, helping organizations shape their future direction with purpose.\nHow It Strengthens Strategic Thinking\nThe map reshapes how managers think about strategy. It directs attention to activities as part of a system rather than isolated actions.\nA training program provides a clear example. It builds skills, supports company culture, improves customer service, and creates consistency across departments.\nWhen managers view activities through this lens, they can measure the broader effect of their decisions. That view helps them focus on actions that strengthen the company’s position and avoid choices that scatter resources without benefit.\nKey Benefits of Using an Activity System Map\n- Better Decision-Making: Managers can evaluate if a new opportunity fits within the current system or creates conflict.\n- Improved Alignment: Teams can clearly see how their work supports company goals.\n- Competitive Strength: The network of activities makes it more difficult for competitors to copy the full strategy.\n- Dual Role: It serves both as a diagnostic tool and a forward-looking guide for shaping future plans.\nLinking to Other Strategic Concepts\nThe activity system map connects well with other models. A good example is the flywheel concept in business. The flywheel focuses on momentum and shows how small, consistent actions build lasting energy over time.\nTogether, the activity system map and the flywheel highlight an important idea. Strategy depends on a system of connected activities that support one another and drive the organization forward.\nHow to Create an Activity System Map\nAn activity system map takes shape through a clear process. Each stage turns raw information into a structured view of how activities support the organization’s strengths.\nThe goal is to reveal the system behind the strategy and make connections visible.\n1. Collect the Foundation\nBegin with the documents that define the organization. Financial statements, mission statements, strategy reports, and internal reviews provide the foundation.\nSources like this reveal priorities, resource use, and the most important activities in place.\n2. Identify Strategic Activities\nAnalyze the information to find the activities and policies that reinforce the organization’s core competencies. Place them into broad themes such as innovation, efficiency, or customer focus.\nEach theme acts as an anchor in the system map.\n3. Build the Visual Map\nConvert the analysis into a diagram. Use mapping tools to link activities with the themes and highlight how they support one another.\nThe map should clearly display how every action connects to the overall strategy.\n4. Confirm Accuracy with Teams\nShare the draft with team members across departments. Their input ensures the map reflects real operations and not only leadership assumptions.\nCollaboration at this stage also creates shared commitment to the strategy.\nWhat Makes an Activity System Map Effective\nAn effective activity system map does not simply show activities in a loose arrangement. It highlights the strength of a strategy by demonstrating how tightly connected the activities are to one another and to the company’s core competencies.\nA dense network of links signals clarity of direction and a system that reinforces itself.\nStrong Connections Show Strategic Fit\nWhen a map is full of links between activities, managers can see that the organization has an integrated approach. Each action supports another, which creates a strong overall structure.\nThis reduces duplication, strengthens execution, and ensures every part of the business contributes to long-term goals.\nWeak Connections Reveal Gaps\nA map with very few connections tells a different story. Sparse links can signal misalignment, wasted resources, or an unclear direction.\nBy analyzing where connections are missing, leaders can identify areas that need adjustment. That view prevents blind spots and provides a starting point for improvement.\nA Tool for Generating New Ideas\nThe value of the map goes beyond diagnosis. It also supports creativity in strategy. Reviewing the diagram can uncover new ways to link activities, improve existing ones, or develop features and products that add competitive strength.\nThe map encourages managers to think in terms of systems instead of single actions.\nAgility Through Continuous Review\nAn effective map is not static. By returning to the diagram as conditions change, organizations can remain adaptable. Market shifts, new technologies, and evolving customer needs demand updates.\nIt helps leaders adjust while keeping the overall system intact and aligned with long-term goals.\nPractical Applications\nActivity system maps have a wide range of practical applications in strategic planning and operational management.\nThey are particularly useful for:\n- Decision Making: Activity maps help organizations make incremental decisions about new opportunities. By visualizing how a new idea fits into the existing strategy, managers can assess its potential impact and avoid undermining other aspects of the business.\n- Communication: These maps are valuable communication tools that illustrate how every function and policy contributes to the organization’s strategy. They can be used to cascade key performance indicators (KPIs) throughout the organization, ensuring alignment and accountability at all levels.\n- Identifying Misfits: Activity maps highlight areas where current activities may undermine the organization’s strategic goals. Identifying these misfits allows organizations to make necessary adjustments and ensure that all activities support the overall strategy.\n- Outsourcing Decisions: By defining the boundary of the organization’s core activities, activity maps help managers make informed decisions about outsourcing. Activities that are not central to the organization’s competitive advantage can be outsourced to enhance cost-effectiveness without risking strategic coherence.\n- New Ventures and Acquisitions: Activity maps are essential for evaluating the strategic fit of new ventures or acquisitions. If the activity maps of two businesses are significantly different, combining them could create trade-offs and inefficiencies. Keeping them separate may be more advantageous, even if it increases costs.\nRyanair as an Example of a Low-Cost Strategy\nRyanair offers a clear view of how an activity system map strengthens a business model. The airline is known for keeping fares lower than most competitors, and the system of activities behind that promise shows why the approach works.\nThe entire strategy centers on cost leadership. The company prioritizes efficiency over luxury and designs its operations around what customers value most: cheap and reliable travel.\nActivities that Support the Strategy\n- Single aircraft model: Using only Boeing 737 planes reduces training needs, lowers maintenance costs, and simplifies operations.\n- Secondary airports: Flying to smaller airports cuts landing fees, avoids heavy traffic, and speeds up turnaround times.\n- Basic service model: Optional extras such as food, baggage, or seat selection generate revenue while keeping base fares low.\n- Fast turnaround: Ground operations are streamlined, allowing planes to fly more routes each day and spread costs across more passengers.\nThe strength of the system lies in the links. The choice of one aircraft type supports quick turnarounds. Secondary airports align with the low-cost model by reducing fees and delays. Optional extras add revenue without undermining the promise of low fares. Each part reinforces the others, making the system difficult for rivals to copy in isolation.\nAdobe Analytics Activity Map\nAdobe Analytics offers a feature called Activity Map that shows how visitors interact with websites and mobile apps. It provides direct visibility into where people click, where they spend time, and how they move through a page.\nThe goal is simple: give teams a clear view of what users actually do, so design and content decisions can be based on evidence.\nHow It Shows Behavior\nActivity Map places visual markers on a page to reveal where users engage.\nClicks, scrolls, and hovers are tracked, then displayed in a format that highlights strong and weak areas.\nInstead of digging through spreadsheets, managers can see real behavior on top of the page itself.\nHeat Map Insights\nHeat maps add color to interaction data. Areas that attract attention appear warmer, while areas with little activity stay cooler. This makes it easy to see which buttons, links, or sections drive the most value.\nTeams use that knowledge to refine layout, adjust calls to action, and improve user flow.\nElement-Level Reporting\nOverlay reports break down engagement by specific items on a page. Each link, button, or feature shows exact numbers, which helps when comparing designs or testing new features.\nSuch a high level of details that guide small changes that often have a big impact.\nUnderstanding Different Audiences\nThe feature also allows segmentation. A team can view how mobile users behave compared to desktop visitors, or how traffic from one campaign differs from another.\nPractical Use\nActivity Map is widely used in conversion optimization, A/B testing, and mobile app design. It highlights underperforming elements, supports navigation improvements, and helps measure the effect of design changes.\nThe benefit is clear: teams can act on real behavior instead of assumptions.\nConclusion\nAn activity system map gives leaders a way to see how different parts of a business connect and support each other. It turns scattered actions into a system, making strategy more visible and easier to manage. By mapping the links between activities and core strengths, organizations can spot gaps, strengthen alignment, and focus on choices that build long-term advantage.\nThe value of this tool extends beyond analysis. It supports communication across teams, guides investment decisions, and helps identify new opportunities for growth.\nWhen combined with digital tools like Adobe Analytics Activity Map, the framework becomes even stronger, offering insight into customer behavior and interaction patterns that shape modern strategy.\nA well-designed map helps a company stay clear in its direction, consistent in its execution, and flexible enough to respond to change. In that way, it remains one of the most practical tools for building and maintaining a competitive edge.",

Leadership, teamwork, and culture design articles that our readers loved the most.\nGet in touch and transform your culture today.\nReach out using the form below and we’ll respond as soon as possible. We appreciate your interest.\nBelow are the most read stories we published in 2021. Leadership, teamwork, and culture design articles that our readers loved the most.\nBy Gustavo Razzetti\nDecember 16, 2021\n2021 was anything but a dull year. Some people call it the worst year ever, while others are starting to see hope as the pandemic feels more under control. Whatever your experience has been, we invite you to reflect on what has worked (or not) and to appreciate all the good things that happened in 2021 – don't let bad news cloud your achievements.\nEvery year, our team gets together to reflect on our challenges and progress, too. One of our key measures of success is the impact our work creates – not in terms of business but in terms of contributing to building more human workplaces.\nIn 2021, participants from over 250 cities across six continents joined our open programs. One million unique visitors read at least 3, or more posts and our free tools have been downloaded 100,000+ times in the past 12 months. These are not just numbers, but a reflection of the appetite for insights and t,ools to build better workplaces. And we are honored to be part of your journey.\nEvery year, we also review the most read articles in the Fearless Culture blog – another indicator of what matters to our readers.\nHere's the list of the most-read articles across the five different categories: culture design, leadership, teamwork, personal growth, and tools.\nPsychological safety is the foundation of high-performing teams. However, it has become more challenging for remote and distributed teams to make everyone feel safe, included, and to share their ideas. Try this curated list of activities, tools, and exercises.\nThis simplified version of the culture design canvas is perfect for hybrid and remote teams to reset how they work. Move from synchronous to asynchronous collaboration, reimagine a shared future, increase belonging, and release agility. Check it out.\nSuccessful workplace cultures don't happen by accident, but by design. Learn how Netflix, Zappos, IKEA, Slack, HubSpot, Pixar, and Amazon (among others) were able to build and maintain strong company cultures.\nCompany values establish core beliefs and guiding principles. Core values matter because they define how the company does business and what's expected of people. This in-depth post will help you understand why values matter, how to choose yours, mistakes to avoid, and inspiration from various organizations.\nThe ego has a bad rap, lately becoming the villain in most personal growth articles. What if instead of trying to get rid of our ego, we reframe our relationship with it? Your ego is not the problem; stop treating it as the enemy.\nChanging people's behavior is anything but easy, especially when everyone is working from different places. Virtual team rituals are perfect to increase awareness and to give team members a nudge. They should definitely be part of your playbook.\nThe question is not if psychological safety matters or not, but how. The Psychological Safety Ladder addresses the three levels: belonging, cognitive diversity, and innovation. You must achieve one level to move to the next one – most importantly, the higher you climb the ladder, the safer it feels to take more risks. Read how.\nThere are dozens of leadership theories and styles – some are better than others. Rather than looking for the perfect model to adopt, this post invites you to discover your authentic leadership style and develop it.\nThe biggest challenges of a hybrid workplace are not operational or technological, but cultural. Rather than focusing so much on process, organizations need to change their mindset. You can't understand the hybrid place if you don't update your views first.\nThere are three types of conversations at work: the ones we avoid, the ones that kill culture, and the ones that transform it. What about your team? The quality of your culture depends on the quality of your conversations.\nNot all company cultures are made equal. Each one is unique – with both pros and cons. How to choose your type of culture wisely.\nThe Culture Design Canvas has quickly become the tool of choice for many organizational designers who care about building more purpose-driven, agile, and innovative workplace cultures. This updated post will help you map yours.\nPrevious\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse varius enim in eros elementum tristique.

    "content": "Most of the OnStrategy Team lives in Nevada, so we know a thing or two about gambling (and sometimes you can get lucky!!). However, most leaders prefer to play it safe with the future of their companies. We suspect you feel the same way. The problem for most organizations, and many of our clients, is great market data is too expensive and time consuming to gather.\nSo what’s the solution? We’ve put together an easy-to-use summary of questions to answer and data sources to access for free (ish).\nPro Tip: Strive to be directionally correct, not decimal point perfect!\nQuestions You’re Looking to Answer With Data\nWe cover this in our Growth Strategy Guide, but internal and external data are required to inform and help answer key strategic questions as your team builds a growth strategy. Markets are the opportunities in your SWOT that are discreet and definable as you can go after them and they’re of a size that will make a difference to your organization.\nPro-tip: don’t forget to assess the markets you currently serve—there could be more growth from them!\nMost importantly, data is invaluable in helping answer these four questions:\nQuestion 1: “What is happening in your market/industry?”\n- How big is the market?\n- What is the growth rate?\n- What are the market’s trends?\n- What is your current share and position in the market?\nQuestion 2: “Who are our competitors and when they win, why do they win?”\n- Who are the top 5-10 competitors?\n- What is their share/revenue and growth rate?\n- What is their competitive advantage?\n- What are their weaknesses or vulnerabilities?\nDoes Your Strategy Suck? Get this Free Guide to Find Out.\nDOWNLOAD THE FREE STRATEGY SOFTWARE GUIDE\nQuestion 3: “What customers do you (or can you) serve?”\n- What’s happening in your customer’s businesses?\n- What have we heard from our current customers – needs, insights, challenges?\n- What is changing in your customer’s behaviors?\n- Are there unmet customer needs that we are positioned to fill with the right product/service?\n- Are there new customers/segments emerging to serve?\nQuestion 4: “How are we performing today and where are the external opportunities?”\n- How are current products/services performing? Do any need to be sunsetted due to poor profitability?\n- How are we performing across our channels?\n- Are there gaps in our current portfolio? Are there any obvious product/service adjacencies?\nPro-Tip: As a general rule, allocate a couple of weeks for gathering and synthesizing the data. To keep the scope from breaking any one team member, assign out gathering and synthesizing to different members of your strategy team, e.g., divvy up the work by market or business line.\nInternal Data to Gather\nEvery organization has access to a unique internal data; what your organization possesses largely depends on what you do and how (or whether) you capture it. Here is a short list of suggested internal data you’ll find useful to your growth strategy work:\n- Past 3 Years Revenue & Next 3- to 5-Year Forecast – Revenue by customer segment, revenue by product line/service offering\n- Profitability – Operating costs, EBITDA by line of business or market\n- Marketing Performance – Web traffic analytics, keyword reports, earned and paid media performance and for a few share-of-voice might be a data point you capture\n- Sales Performance and Pipelines – Closed business, pipeline forecast, time to close\n- Staff Insights – including employee engagement/satisfaction, product or service delivery performance\n- Customer Insights & Customer Analytics – Log in sessions, time spent using product, average customer value, customer satisfaction/ratings and needs\nPro-Tip: Gathering this data can be delegated to the functional heads of your team.\nExternal Data to Gather\nAccessing and using internal data is easier than finding and leveraging external data sources for most organizations.\nIn fact, a survey from Gartner said nearly half use external data in their analytics activities. While that number is still increasing, it does mean that many organizations don’t leverage objective external data and information as they build their approach to growth. We think this is gambling with your future.\nExamples of External Data – Adapted from McKinsey & Deloitte\n- Consumer Data – Demographics, media consumption, social media usage, consumer behavior\n- Labor Markets – Labor forecasts, labor market size, labor growth or reduction\n- Economic Forecasts – Market sizing, market growth, consumer spending forecasts\n- Marketing Data – Addressable search traffic, addressable audience sizes, industry CPC or CPA averages\n- Supply Chain Data – Lead times, availability of product for manufacturing, shipping routes or times\n- Local Data – Growth or reduction in metros, population by zip code, demographics by zip code\n- Real Estate – Forecasted commercial/residential values, market forecasts for rent, affordability indexes\nWhere to Find External Data for Your Growth Strategy\nThe reasons many teams skip gathering external data is it’s difficult to get and there’s the perception that the data will be expensive. We hear you; but before skipping it altogether, have your team spend some time looking at free (or almost free) sources of external data. Here are a few great sources we use when we work with clients to assess their market and build their approach to growth:\nPro-Tip: Do the math. if you stand to grow by $X million, is the investment in purchasing data worth a few thousand dollars?\nStatista\nThis is one of our favorite sources to use! It is a database that aggregates tons of a valuable statistics, market reports, industry reports, trends, company reports, and market outlooks in a single source. It’s not free, but it’s really affordable with their single account currently on sale at $39/month.\nSEM Rush, MOZ, Alexa\nSEM Rush and MOZ are well-known search engine optimization tools that can provide valuable insight into how your business is performing in organic search, what trends are occuring in your search market, audience insights, and benchmarking your website against your competition. These are not free tools, but for around $99 a month, they provide valuable real-world data into how your website performs in the digital world.\nIndustry-Specific Associations\nThere is likely at least one industry association you can tap into that probably has relevant quantitative and qualitative data and reports that might be valuable as you build your growth strategy. Do a quick Google search to find national, regional and international associations in your industry if you’re not already a member of a few.\nBureau of Labor and Statistics\nThis Federal government agency is a treasure-trove of data that includes information about the labor market, the U.S. economy, state-level data, and other information on major economic indicators that could be valuable as you assess your current market condition and are looking for mega trends and even growth rates of a market.\nU.S. Census\nThe census provides information about the population of the United States, including information about demographics, health, education, employment, housing, income, and more.\nHigher Education Institutions (Academic Papers)\nDepending on your industry and field of play, there may be academic papers with valuable information and data you can use for your strategy. Google Scholar is a great tool to use for academic paper research.\nYou Need the Data!\nThe cold truth is you cannot build a great growth strategy without a holistic view of what is happening in your macro and micro environment. That view can only come from digging into the data that is available to your organization from internal and external sources.\nIn our next newsletter, we will help you use your internal and external data as you begin building your growth strategy for 2022 in the next few months.",

    "domain": "highnorth.co.uk",
    "age": "1,548 days ago",
    "content": "Lactate Testing For Cyclists Explained\nUsing lactate as a performance measure offers a number of benefits over just power and heart rate data alone (e.g. FTP testing or power profiling).\nIn this post, we will explain the key insights that lactate testing can provide, and how this can be used to guide your training, including some case studies demonstrating use of lactate data in practice.\nWhilst blood lactate testing has typically been associated with a costly and time-consuming visit to a sports laboratory, we will also explain how it is now possible to conduct repeatable, convenient and cost-effective lactate testing at home. If you’re looking for step-by-step guidance on how to perform lactate testing, check out our protocol guide here.\nLet’s start by making sure we understand exactly what lactate is and then dive right into the benefits that testing can provide...\nWhat is lactate?\nLactate is produced when carbohydrates (in the form of glycogen or glucose) are broken down anaerobically (without oxygen) to produce energy, in a process called ‘glycolysis’. The end-product of this reaction is a substance called ‘pyruvate’. Some of this pyruvate is then transported into the mitochondria of the cell, and processed by the aerobic energy system to produce more energy, plus some innocuous water and carbon dioxide.\nThe remainder of the pyruvate is instead converted into a substance called lactate and some other metabolites. Lactate then typically enters the blood stream, where it’s transported to other cells in the body and oxidised to produce energy.\nLactate often gets a bad rap, as many people think it’s the substance that causes fatigue in high-intensity exercise. However, while the mechanisms contributing to fatigue in exercise are still unclear, it’s now thought that it’s the metabolites that are produced alongside lactate that contribute to fatigue, rather than the lactate itself. It’s thought that these metabolites signal to the central nervous system that a metabolic steady state has been exceeded, and that exercise intensity needs to be reduced.\nIn contrast to previous thinking, it’s now accepted that lactate itself is a positive product of glycolysis. Not only does it act as a signal to trigger helpful physiological responses (such as increased heart rate), but it is also an important source of fuel that can be directly oxidised in mitochondria to produce energy, or can be converted back to glucose or glycogen for later use.\nLactate can be easily measured in the blood, using a small finger-tip sample of blood, and can tell us a lot of information about the metabolic processes that are going on in the body.\nLactate And Training Intensity\nThe amount of lactate in the blood is dependent on how much lactate is produced, and how quickly it’s cleared. Both of these factors are influenced by exercise intensity.\nFirst of all, you may know that energy is almost entirely derived from either fats or carbohydrates during exercise (there are some minor exceptions, but they aren’t relevant here). Generating energy from fats is slower than from carbohydrates. So as exercise intensity increases, a greater proportion of energy is generated from carbohydrates, via glycolysis, leading to a higher lactate production rate.\nIn other words, as exercise intensity increases, the rate of lactate production also increases due to increased glycolysis.\nSecondly, lactate production and clearance also depends upon the availability of oxygen relative to demand, which is itself dependent on exercise intensity. When exercising at really high intensities, oxygen supply cannot meet demand, and a greater proportion of the pyruvate must be converted into lactate rather than being oxidised directly. Furthermore, due to the limited oxygen availability, the accumulating lactate cannot be oxidised, and therefore cannot be cleared from the blood and muscles unless exercise intensity is reduced.\nIn other words, at higher exercise intensities supply of oxygen to the working muscles cannot meet demand, and rates of lactate production begin to exceed the rate at which they can be cleared, leading to an exponential increase in the rates of lactate production.\nThese two factors give rise to a fairly distinctive relationship between lactate and intensity, which can be divided into several zones as shown:\nIn Zone 1, energy production is largely met by fat oxidation, and the contribution from glycolysis is negligible. Lactate levels are therefore approximately constant and do not increase with exercise intensity (this is a slight simplification, but the details are beyond the scope of this article). Zone 1 is the intensity range in which you’d usually do a long endurance ride.\nIn Zone 2, glycolysis starts to make a larger contribution to energy production, because fat alone cannot produce energy fast enough. In this zone, lactate levels rise linearly with exercise intensity. However, oxygen supply is still sufficient to clear lactate at the same rate at which it is produced. Therefore, at any given exercise intensity, lactate levels will stay constant.\nThis means intensities within Zone 2 can be sustained for a long time, but might be a little more uncomfortable than they would be in Zone 1, due to the elevated lactate levels (or more particularly the associated fatiguing metabolites). The higher exercise intensity will also contribute more overall stress and damage, which is why you’d typically look to moderate the amount of training you do in Zone 2, which is often referred to as the ‘Tempo’ or ‘Sweetspot’ zone.\nIn Zone 3, lactate levels begin to rise exponentially. At this point, oxygen supply cannot meet demand, and lactate production begins to exceed clearance. At any given Zone 3 intensity, lactate levels will rise despite power being held constant, and thus intensities in this zone can only be sustained for a relatively short time. These are the intensities that you’d typically train at during an interval session.\nMeasuring lactate can therefore be a useful method for defining training zones. These zones are tied to actual metabolic conditions within the body, and thus can have better physiological validity than zones based on FTP or heart rate anchor points (e.g. max heart rate).\nThe cut-points between these zones have various names, with the lower cut point often referred to as the aerobic threshold or LT1, and the upper cut-point being referred to as the anaerobic threshold, the lactate threshold, the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS), onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) or LT2 (some of these terms have subtly different definitions, but for the purposes of this article, we will treat them as meaning the same thing). FTP is a field-based estimate of LT2, which does not involve lactate testing, and typically tends to over-estimate LT2.\nLactate And Fitness Profile\nNot only do lactate concentrations depend upon exercise intensity, they also depend upon an athlete’s unique physiology and fitness level.\nTwo key variables dictate how lactate levels vary within a given individual. These are:\nVO2max (also known as aerobic capacity)\nThis dictates the maximal rate at which oxygen can be supplied to the working muscles, and thus the point at which lactate production exceeds the body’s capacity to clear lactate (i.e. LT2).\nThe maximal glycolytic rate (also known as lactic power or glycolytic power)\nThis is the maximal rate at which energy can be produced though glycolysis. It’s thought that a higher maximal glycolytic rate often correlates with a greater the tendency to produce energy via glycolysis across the spectrum of intensities (although this isn’t always true at an individual level). Thus, for two individuals with the same VO2max, lactate production rates will typically be higher in the individual with the higher maximal glycolytic rate, typically (but not always) leading to a lower LT1 and LT2 power in this individual.\nGiven that lactate is a product of glycolysis, the maximal glycolytic rate can be approximated by measuring the rate at which lactate is produced during a short, maximal effort (10-30S). This is referred to as VLaMax (the maximal lactate production rate). It’s measured as the rate at which lactate concentration increases in the blood per second (mmol/L/sec).\nBringing these two factors together, we can say that LT2 is a balance between VO2max and VLaMax, as illustrated in the figure below. If VO2max increases relative to VLaMax, LT2 generally increases. If VO2max decreases relative to VLaMax, LT2 generally decreases.\nVLaMax values typically range from 0.2mmol/L/sec to 1.0mmol/L/sec. For most endurance sports, it’s been suggested that you’d want this to ideally sit somewhere between 0.3mmol/L/sec and 0.5mmol/L/sec (the lower end for more steady-state disciplines, and the higher end for more punchy disciplines).\nHowever, VLaMax can be hard to measure with precision and reliability because it requires the athlete to produce a maximal sprint, depends upon discrete measures of blood lactate concentrations (meaning the true maximum lactate level can be missed) and is very sensitive to factors such as nutrition and fatigue.\nAs the lactate sample is also taken usually at the finger or earlobe, which is relatively distant from the site of production (i.e. leg muscles), any resulting measures will also be influenced by factors such as lactate transport/shuttling ability, and total blood volume.\nThus, any measure of VLamax will only ever be approximate. Additionally, the ‘optimum’ VLaMax will depend on the athlete’s aerobic capacity, with a high VO2max allowing a higher VLaMax to be tolerated while still maintaining a good endurance and threshold power. Thus in practice, we don’t think these precise VLaMax targets are overly useful. We prefer to test VLaMax just to get a broad picture of whether this appears to be generally high, medium or low.\nOther Factors\nThere are also some other factors that can impact lactate levels, including the ability to use fats to produce energy, which is dependent on things like mitochondrial density, and oxidative enzyme activity.\nLactate transport (i.e. the ability to move lactate out of the working muscle fibres to other parts of the body) also impacts the lactate-power relationship. A highly active muscle fibre (e.g. in the leg) might already be working at an intensity where oxygen supply cannot meet demand. If lactate could not be transported out of the cell, it would quickly accumulate. However, by improving the ability to transport lactate away from the working muscles to other parts of the body, where oxygen is more plentiful, this allows more lactate to be oxidised. Thus, an improved lactate shuttling can lead to lower lactate levels at a given exercise intensity.\nLet’s take a look at some lactate profiles for people with differing fitness parameters:\nExample 1\nThis first example shows two athletes with very similar maximal glycolytic rates and propensities to use fats for fuel. This is indicated by their similar VLaMax values and lactate concentrations at low intensities (similar LT1 powers). The big difference between these two athletes is their aerobic capacity. Athlete 1 (orange) has a lower aerobic capacity, meaning the point at which lactate production exceeds lactate clearance (LT2) is at a lower intensity.\nExample 2\nIn this example, both athletes have a similar aerobic capacity, but athlete 1 (orange) has a higher VLaMax, which results in higher lactate values across the spectrum of intensities, and lower LT1 and LT2 powers.\nAs can be seen from the above, lactate testing can be used to help understand an athlete’s unique physiological parameters – in particular their aerobic and anaerobic capacities.\nLet’s now take a look at some examples of how lactate testing can be used in practice.\nCase Study: Assessing Change Over Time\nOne key benefit of lactate testing is the ability to assess and unpick physiological changes within an athlete over time. We can see this in the example below.\nExample 1\nIn this example, an athlete was tested on two occasions (first = orange, second = blue). On both occasions, the athlete had a very similar VLaMax, indicating that there was probably no significant change in the athlete’s maximal glycolytic rate.\nHowever, the athlete’s LT1, and particularly LT2 powers appear to have increased, with his lactate curve broadly shifting to the right. This might be explained by an improved aerobic capacity resulting in a reduction in lactate production and an increased capacity to clear lactate. We can therefore conclude that the athlete’s recent training has probably been effective at improving aerobic capacity.\nLet’s look at a second example:\nExample 2\nSimilarly to the first example, in this second example, LT2 has again improved.\nHowever, in this example, VLaMax has decreased by a notable amount. Assuming there are no obvious confounding variables (e.g. the athlete was notably fatigued or under-fuelled on the second test day, and was similarly hydrated) it appears likely that the vast majority of the improvement in the athlete’s LT2 power is due to a decreased rate of glycolysis. There may have been a change in the athlete’s aerobic capacity, fat oxidation or lactate shuttling ability, but this was probably small, given the large apparent change in VLaMax.\nIf we were to conduct an FTP test with the athletes in examples 1 and 2, we’d have seen an improved FTP, but we’d have had no idea what physiological changes have caused this, and thus how the athlete has responded to the training. This clearly illustrates a key benefit of lactate testing in allowing us to better unpick the physiological adaptations occurring ‘under the hood’. The testing is not perfect by any means, but it provides some additional information beyond power testing alone.\nCase Study 3: Assessing Clearance Rates\nSo far, we have focussed on the lactate curve and VLaMax. One further piece of information we can look at, however, is the lactate clearance rate. This can give us additional information about improvements in VO2max and/or lactate shuttling ability.\nAfter a hard effort that produces a high level of lactate, we can measure lactate concentrations over time, producing a graph like this:\nThe faster the lactate clears, the better the lactate clearance abilities. In the graph above, the orange line represents better lactate clearance, and might suggest an improved VO2max or ability to shuttle lactate (we can infer where this change might have come from by looking at the type of training the athlete has been doing and any evidence for changes in VO2max from the other lactate tests discussed above).\nLactate Testing vs Power-Based Testing (e.g. FTP)\nAt this stage, you may be wondering whether lactate testing is necessary, or whether similar physiological inferences could be made from power-based testing. Power-based testing is common in cycling, whether this is testing FTP via a time-trial or ramp test, or testing power over a range of durations (typically around 5 seconds, and 1, 5 and 20 minutes).\nWhile useful, these power-based tests have some key limitations when compared with lactate testing:\n1. Power is always generated by a combination of energy systems.\nThis means that, if increases or decreases in power are seen, it’s not possible to tell which energy system is responsible, and thus what physiological changes have occurred.\nFor example, while the 1-minute test is often interpreted as representing anaerobic power, there is still a considerable contribution from the aerobic energy system. Thus, an improvement in 1-minute power could be due to an improvement in either the anaerobic or aerobic energy systems.\nLikewise, the 20-min test is typically used to estimate FTP and/or infer changes in LT2. However, an improved 20-min power could actually be due to an increased anaerobic power, which would usually act to reduce LT2! In other words, the results of the 20-min test could lead us to believe the opposite of what’s actually occurred.\nIn contrast, lactate testing can give us a better understanding of what processes are going on in the body at different intensities, and what changes are occurring over time, because lactate levels are more closely linked to metabolic processes within the body.\n2. Zones based on power testing are typically generalised\nMost people will set their training zones and interval intensities based on fixed percentages of FTP. For example, using the classic Coggan zones, VO2max intensity would be defined as 106-120% FTP. However, these training zones do not hold true for all athletes.\nUsing lactate testing can allow for training zones to be individualised based on the actual metabolic processes going on in the body. Some additional testing would be needed to determine some more detailed training zones above the lactate threshold (we’d usually use a combination of perceived exertion, examining heart rate data and using self-paced testing to do that – see here). However, lactate testing provides a good starting point for determining training zones.\nLactate Testing Misconceptions\nGiven the benefits of lactate testing, it’s perhaps surprising that it’s not more common in training. Here is a summary of some misconceptions of lactate testing and why each need not be of concern:\nIt’s painful. Actually, the effort level you need to ride at during a lactate test is typically not as hard as when you’re doing a power profile or FTP test. Blood samples for lactate testing are taken from a small finger-prick sample, which causes very little pain.\nIt requires a lab. In fact, lactate testing can be done out on the road or trail, or on an indoor trainer at home. All you need is a power meter and the lactate testing equipment.\nIt’s super expensive. While testing in the lab can be quite costly, if you do the testing yourself, it can be very cost-effective and doesn’t need to cost £100s per test. One great way to cut costs further is to split the cost of the lactate analyser (which is the biggest outlay) with friends, so you can all get involved with lactate testing.\nIt’s difficult to do. Lactate test protocols can actually be as simple as a normal interval workout (often simpler) and lactate sampling is fairly easy after a little practice (although this can depend on the analyser you use).\nHome-Based Lactate Testing\nNow that most people have access to power meters or smart trainers, it’s really simple to do lactate testing at home, by purchasing a portable lactate analyser and the associated equipment (lancets, lactate strips etc.).\nBeyond the obvious benefits of saving time and money, carrying out home-based lactate testing has several benefits over lab-based testing.\nFirst, by doing testing at home, you can use better protocols. The best and most accurate/information-rich protocols require quite a lot of time and resources to perform. They are therefore often not offered by many labs. For example, many labs do not test for VLaMax, and very rarely looks at lactate clearance rates. By testing at home, you can make sure to include these additional tests.\nSecondly, testing can be performed using a bike and equipment that you use daily. This will eliminate any problems relating to miscalibration between your power meter and the lab’s equipment. It’s also important because your lactate results can be affected by riding position (because you activate different muscles). Often laboratory bikes can have you in quite an unnatural upright position that’s quite different from your usual riding position.\nTo help you get started with home-based lactate testing, we’ve produced an article outlining key protocols here. However, below is a very brief summary of the types of protocols you can do at home:\nLactate Profile Step Test. In this protocol power is increased in regular steps, and a lactate sample is taken towards the end of each step. It can be used to plot lactate curves like the ones in this article and determine approximations of LT1 and LT2.\nVLaMax Test with Optional Clearance. This test involves riding as hard as possible for around 20-seconds, and then taking lactate samples at regular intervals while resting. This test can be used to identify the peak lactate concentration, and the lactate clearance rate.\nMaximal Lactate Steady State Test. This test involves completing several 10-minute fixed-power stages at close to your expected LT2 power. Lactate samples are taken at two time-points within each stage to assess whether lactate concentrations have increased. LT2 can be identified accurately as the highest stage within which lactate did not increase.\nLimitations\nIt’s important to acknowledge the limitations of lactate testing. Lactate monitors are prone to error, particularly if you’re new to lactate testing and/or if you use a lactate monitor that requires large samples of blood or is very sensitive to contamination (e.g. from sweat). This can make interpretation of results hard, because it can be difficult to determine if any measures are erroneous. In our experience, at least three or four rounds of testing are needed in order to confidently understand your lactate profile, and eliminate incorrect readings. Thus, lactate testing is only really valuable if you’re committed to performing this on a fairly regular basis.\nLactate results are also sensitive to numerous factors unrelated to fitness status, such as nutrition, time of day, fatigue, stress, caffeine intake and so on. While you can do your best to control these factors, they will still exert an influence to some degree.\nFinally, lactate samples are by no means a perfect measure of what’s going on ‘under the hood’. Lactate is produced at the muscle fibre, and this can then be shuttled to other neighbouring muscle fibres for use as fuel, or transported into the blood stream and then to other parts of the body, where it can be used as fuel or converted back to glycogen. A lactate measure from blood at the fingertip or ear lobe is therefore quite distant from what’s going on metabolically at the working muscle. The measure we see will be influenced by things like total blood volume/body size, how effectively lactate is transported around the body, and how effectively lactate can be metabolised or otherwise cleared, and these factors will differ markedly from person to person. We think that there are better alternatives to lactate testing, such as use of near-infrared spectroscopy to measure muscle oxygen saturation in the muscle capillaries (e.g. using a MOXY device). However, lactate testing remains a relatively cost-effective option and can certainly provide useful insight when better (but more costly/less accessible) options are not available.\nSummary\nWe hope this article has provided you with a good understanding of how lactate data can complement your training, and how home-based testing could provide a convenient means to incorporate this into your training more regularly.\nHowever, if you’d like some more guidance on lactate testing, such as how to pick the right protocol(s) or how to understand the test results, we can provide a number of solutions and advice geared towards helping with this.

    "content": "If you are about to rebrand your firm, an exciting opportunity lies ahead to change the way prospective clients think about your organization. And the process that takes you from here to there is called brand design.\nBut many people don’t fully understand what brand design is, how it works and what it can achieve. In this guide, we provide the fundamentals you need to dive into a rebranding program with your eyes wide open to its marvelous possibilities.\nWho Is this Guide For?\nWe developed this guide to help any professional services marketing director, firm principal or stakeholder understand the value of brand design and how you can use it to attract better prospects, improve engagement and start building loyalty at the earliest stages of the buyer journey.\nWhat Is Brand Design?\nLet’s begin with a simple definition. Brand design is the deliberate process of changing the way a firm is perceived in the marketplace. This process has both strategic outcomes, such as positioning and messaging, and visual outcomes, such as a firm’s new logo, color palette and marketing collateral.\nWhile many people associate the term “brand design” solely with a brand’s visual components — its “brand identity” — that definition is incomplete. There is much more to designing a brand than manipulating color, type and imagery. Without a strong strategic foundation, a firm’s brand identity will lack purpose and emotional power. To pull off a fully realized, coherent brand design requires a broad range of skills, from research and strategy to writing and graphic design.\nHow Brand Design Differs from Brand and Branding\nThe language used in branding can be confusing. How is brand design different from branding or, for that matter, a brand? In fact, these three concepts are closely related.\nIf you boil away all the hype, a brand is nothing more than a perception. It’s the way clients and the outside world perceive a firm. It is how people think about and experience it. When people talk to others about your firm — the way they feel and what they say about you — that’s your brand. You can express this perception as an equation with two variables:\nReputation x Visibility\nPut simply, a strong brand is both well regarded and widely known.\nBranding, on the other hand, is a deliberate program to produce a desirable brand. When a firm undergoes rebranding, it assembles a team — usually a combination of internal and external resources — to change the way their business is perceived in the marketplace. An effective branding program will address both reputation and visibility.\nFinally, brand design is the process of building that brand, using brand strategy and positioning as guiding principles. The strategy can then be communicated through messaging and visuals. When people talk about the branding process, they are talking about brand design.\nWhy Brand Design Matters\nA lot of firm executives believe that the value their firms deliver is a direct function of their expertise. Here’s how they think: if providing outstanding professional service is all about the people, is investing in an expensive brand identity even worth it? What good does a fancy new logo, a sweeet set of business cards or a $70,000 website do you, anyway? We’re in the expertise business, not selling a fantasy or pushing a product.\nSadly, these leaders are mistaken. Expertise has no inherent value at all. Until, that is, people are persuaded it has value.\nBrand design is a powerful tool marketers use to persuade people that a firm delivers exceptional value — even if the firm charges higher fees than their competitors. It delivers the rationale for selecting your firm over your competitors, and it supports that idea with clear messaging and an appealing visual framework that inspires confidence and trust.\nThe Strategic Foundations of Brand Design\nEffective brand design addresses both a buyer’s conscious (rational) and unconscious (irrational) mind. But this doesn’t happen by accident. It requires an underlying strategy, one that distinguishes the firm from similar competitors and is designed to convince a certain segment of buyers that the firm is a perfect match for them. Four components go into a successful brand strategy:\n1. Research\nStudies have shown that the gap between how firms think they are perceived and how they actually are perceived is shockingly wide. The only way you can find out what clients really think about you — what they love and what drives them bonkers — is to engage an independent research professional or firm to interview your clients and prospects. You see, it’s devilishly difficult to get honest answers from clients when you ask them the tough questions yourself. Most of your clients don’t want to hurt your feelings or risk damaging the relationship. However, when interviewed by an impartial third party promising them anonymity, clients feel freer to open up and volunteer useful, sometimes sensitive information. These honest findings are almost always eye-opening, and they provide the crucial ingredients for a powerful differentiation strategy.\n2. Differentiation\nBuyers often struggle to tell professional service providers apart. It’s not unusual for multiple competing service providers to offer more or less the same set of services and use similar language to describe what they do. Differentiation is the first step toward solving that problem. Once you have conducted brand research, you’ll have many of the raw materials to begin drawing up a list of differentiators — those characteristics of your firm that clients and potential buyers value about your firm. You may be able to supplement these findings with other defining characteristics that you know to be true about your firm, such as an industry or service specialty.\nFigure 1. A narrow focus can be an effective way to differentiate your firm.\n3. Strategy & Positioning\nUsing your differentiators as a starting place, you can develop a strategy to position your firm against key competitors and encourage a segment of the market to favor you over the others. Your strategy needs to achieve two things: 1) separate you from similar firms, and 2) establish a reason buyers will choose you. Using your differentiators, strategy and other key features of your firm, you can craft a compact and compelling positioning statement that lays out your unique place in the marketplace. Think of your positioning statement as the storyline that hooks your audience and pulls them in — a narrative you can return to again and again as you develop marketing messages.\n4. Messaging\nYour positioning isn’t worth much if you can’t articulate it to your prospects. That’s why messaging is an essential step in building a persuasive brand. Many teams that go through a firm rebranding discover that, for the first time ever, they are able to explain, simply and clearly, how their firm is different. It’s a magical moment! This messaging comes in many guises, from your elevator pitch to the headlines on your website. Some firms also develop a tagline specifically to support their positioning.\nFigure 2. Personality infuses the messaging on this law firm’s website.\nThe Visual Elements of Brand Design\n“Design is the silent ambassador of your brand”\n—Paul Rand\nWhen most people hear the word “branding,” they think of a company’s logo, signage, collateral, advertising, maybe even its great-looking website. That’s no accident. We are visual beings, and every day we use our eyes to make sense of the things around us — including the businesses we interact with and buy from.\nPsychologists have found that we process visual information more quickly and efficiently than other types, and colors, shapes and pictures can irrationally affect the way we feel about the things we see. That means the appearance of a firm’s marketing materials can influence what we think about a firm, even before we interact with it. When people encounter a clean, scrupulously organized brand identity, they tend to project some of their impressions of the design onto the firm itself — for instance, attention to detail or sophistication.\nThat’s why some firms invest substantial time and money in their brand identity. The result — a tidy system of well-designed components — can evoke positive feelings and emotions. Visual impressions matter, and having a high-credibility brand identity can make it easier to turn prospects into clients. Conversely, a low-credibility brand can do a great deal of harm.\nBrand identity covers a wide spectrum of materials. Which ones a firm chooses to develop depends on how it attracts and nurtures prospective clients. Below, I describe a few of the more common visual brand design elements and materials:\nLogo – It’s said that many businesses confuse their logo for their brand. Whether or not that’s true, the logo is one of the most visible components of a brand, so its outsized reputation has some merit. Your logo is a visual proxy for your firm. As a result, it provides an opportunity to make a statement about your firm, differentiate you visually from competitors and set a compass point for the rest of your brand.\nFigure 3. Nablis’ logo applied to business cards.\nWebsite – Apart from your logo, your website is probably the most visible expression of your brand identity. It is a rich visual medium that can include motion graphics, engaging user interactivity and multimedia elements — so it offers a terrific opportunity to impress your audience. It is also a complex platform that must look great on devices large and small. If it is not designed and built with skill, a lot can go wrong.\nLet’s be honest. Websites are expensive, and great websites can be very expensive. But because virtually every prospect will check out your website, it is one of the most important brand design investments you can make. According to our research, about a third of professional services buyers reject a firm on the basis of its website alone. So be sure to put your marketing budget where your buyers are.\nFigure 4. Grimm + Parker Architects’ website is visually dynamic.\nMarketing Collateral – This is a general term for any outward-facing printed or digital materials that you might supply to a prospective client or job candidate. In these materials — whether a firm brochure, sales sheets or research report — you can explore the full range of your visual brand. From colors and photography to typography and layout, collateral is where designers can strut their stuff and push the creativity of your brand identity.\nFigure 5. EDG2’s firm brochure casts the firm as sophisticated and energetic.\nStationery – In today’s electronic business environment where PDFs, Word docs and email have replaced couriers, snail mail and overnight delivery services, there is less and less need for traditional printed letterhead and envelopes. In fact, some firms have abandoned the paper versions entirely. And while business cards are still common, they are no longer essential equipment at some businesses. Whether or not you have embraced the all-digital workplace, you still need to make a good impression at every touch point with a prospect. Every time you send a letter electronically or on paper, and whenever you hand a prospect your business card, you are delivering visual signals about your credibility and professionalism. High-credibility firms are associated with crisp, elegant design, and making the right impression is especially important on these early-stage, front-line materials.\nFigure 6. Darnall Sykes Wealth Partners’ stationery suite is rich and confident — exactly what a wealth management firm should be.\nOther Elements – Of course, a firm’s visual design can be applied to anything people outside or inside the firm might encounter. Here are a few examples:\n- Tradeshow displays\n- Advertising\n- Social media pages\n- Proposals\n- Pitch decks\n- Deliverables\n- Environmental signage\n- Vehicles\n- Uniforms\nIt’s important that all of your marketing components communicate the qualities and personality of your brand with consistency.\nFigure 7. S&ME vehicle and uniform branding.\nBrand Identity Guidelines – How do you corral your designers and far-flung team of professionals to maintain a visually organized and strategically sound visual identity? Brand identity guidelines are an important part of the answer. (Another, often more challenging part is enforcing the guidelines.) Ask your branding firm to document your identity’s key elements and their usage. Basic guidelines might cover a few key items: your logo, color palette and typography, for instance. A more comprehensive document might include guidance on layout, photography, signage, video, animations and even your writing tone and voice.\nFigure 8. RS&H’s brand style guidelines.\nWhat Separates Great Visual Brand Design from the Ordinary?\nGreat design. It’s tough to define, but you know it when you see.\nOr do you?\nWhy is it, then, that so many firms take similar approaches to their brand identities? Let me illustrate my point. Here are the homepages of nine Chicago accounting firms:\nNotice any problems here?\nFor one thing, all of these homepages are dominated by the color blue, which happens to be the most common color across the professional services. Firms seem to gravitate to “navy” and “royal” blues, in particular. When so many competitors share the same narrow preference for colors, buyers are conditioned from the beginning to believe that their choices are all alike.\nAnother endemic problem is clichéd imagery. These home pages feature the same predictable, tired images, following a familiar, well-worn road. Calculators, pens, charts, computers — these images not only represent a failure of imagination, they compound the buyer’s dilemma. In your industry, the clichés might be chess pieces, boardrooms, mountain climbers, handshakes, eagles, gavels, globes, puzzle pieces, stethoscopes — the list of stale imagery is as exhaustive as it is exhausting. Do any of these look-alike firms bring anything special to the table? The answer, regrettably, is probably not. And if they do, they sure don’t act like it.\nBrand design is an opportunity to break out of the follower mentality and take your brand design in a fresh direction. If most of your competitors have followed a particular visual direction, then take that as your cue — head somewhere else. Almost anywhere else is better than the miasmic mud holes where the herds wallow.\nOf course, not all of your competitors use the color blue. Nor do they all embrace the same types of imagery and layouts. That’s why — before you begin redesigning your identity — you need to find out what your competitors are doing visually. Conduct a formal survey of their visual brands. Can you spot any trends? Then work with your branding partner to explore the open territory where you can differentiate you firm and give your brand room to grow.\nFigure 10. Don’t be afraid to take your brand in a fresh, new visual direction.\nGreat visual brand design is as much about finding your own way as it is about typefaces and colors and grids. When you work with a branding firm or graphic designer, it’s important that you appreciate this concept — encourage your design partner to explore the blue ocean and take some risks. It’s far too easy to settle for a brand design approach that is comfortable and safe. And by “safe,” I mean terrible for your business.\nNow, to explain in this blog post what makes one logo or website design good and another ho-hum is an almost impossible task. Good taste is acquired over time through repeated exposure to exceptional design. An experienced visual brand design partner can navigate the opportunities available to you and help you create an identity that evokes credibility, sophistication and vitality. Here some things to look for in a brand design partner:\n- They know your industry.\n- They’ve worked with brands that you admire.\n- They use research and data to inform their creative decisions.\n- They win design awards. (While you shouldn’t take awards too seriously, they can be a signal that a firm produces distinguished, original work.)\n- They have the confidence to lead you through the rebranding process and explain their recommendations when you have questions.\nAnd to take that last point one step further, it’s up to you to give your branding partner the permission to take your firm into uncharted territory.\nConclusion\nBrand design at its best should challenge you at every turn. A strategy that truly differentiates your firm demands sacrifice — often pruning away client segments or service offerings you’ve grown comfortable with over the years. And a well-conceived brand identity should go out of its way to thumb its nose at the status quo. That’s not to say every great brand design has to be brash or bold. But it should have a personality all its own and a purpose that is clear, easy to grasp and distinctive.\nIn the end, brand design should not be driven by you, at all — it’s the buyer who matters most. Brand design is about making it easy for the buyer to make the right choice in the marketplace. It’s about positioning your firm to be the clear pick and making sure that appropriate prospective clients not only can find your firm but are predisposed to trust it.\nThat’s what brand design is all about.\nHow Hinge Can Help\nThe best brand building strategies help your firm connect with its buyers, build your reputation, and increase your marketplace visibility.

Literally.\nYour buyers can’t see or touch the value you provide -- and unfortunately, your mere promise of exceptional service just won’t cut it when it comes to convincing them.\nBut rest assured: your prospective buyers are out there right now, searching for the very services you provide. With the right marketing strategies, you can lead them right to your digital doorstep.\nThat’s what we have here -- tried-and-true strategies to help your professional services firm attract new business, close more leads and boost your bottom line.\nBefore we jump in, let’s address the unique nature of professional services.\nWhat is professional services marketing and why is it different?\nProfessional services marketing involves promoting a business’s specialized expertise within a given industry. From a marketing perspective, professional services firms face a unique challenge in that they don’t sell a tangible product with tangible features. That means the quality of that service is difficult for your buyers to assess upfront -- and it’s imperative that your marketing strategies are customized accordingly.

Prioritize Organic Search As a Top Marketing Channel\nHow do prospective buyers find you? A recent survey from the Hinge Research Institute examined buying habits of 822 buyers searching for professional services. The study showed that “online search” was the second most popular method, behind personal referrals.\nHere’s what you need to know about online search: businesses don’t just “get lucky” when they show up at the top of search engine results pages (SERP). The companies who are consistently stealing top SERP real estate have invested in organic search strategies that give them high visibility (in turn, driving more traffic to their website). Some of these strategies include:\n- Keyword-driven content strategy (blogs, pillar articles, etc.)\n- On-page SEO elements (keyword optimizing page titles, meta descriptions,\nATL TAGS, featured snippets, etc.) - Paid ads\n- Link-building strategies (including backlinks)\nRemember, today’s typical buyers are all about problem-solving online, with search engines being their likely starting point. It’s your job to make sure you’re meeting them where they are!\nOnce you’re ready to tackle keyword research, check out this helpful blog offering 8 actionable steps: How to Do Keyword Research for Content Marketing.\n2. Build Trust on Your Professional Services Website\nOnce you implement the organic search strategies above, you’ll enjoy a nice bump in traffic to your website. But that only gets you halfway there. What experience do those visitors have once they land there?\nRemember, you’re not the only stop visitors will make -- and you have mere seconds to show your value. Here’s how to make a good first impression.\n- Make it scannable. When it comes to copy, less is more! Opt for succinct headers, clean and simple navigation, graphical representations of your services (charts, icons, etc.) wherever possible, and videos (try for less than one minute) instead of large copy blocks.\n- Offer multiple engagement points -- and keep it conversational. Prospective buyers don’t want to be sold to… but they may be ready for a conversation. Make it easy for them to engage by offering chat features, lead flows, and approachable-sounding CTAs (i.e., Would you like to run your questions by an expert?) that are relevant to the page they are on.\n- Remember that reviews or testimonials are a must. Make no mistake, these are worth their weight in gold. Reviews and testimonials are arguably the next best thing to a personal referral. That’s why 85% of consumers trust them as much as personal recommendations! Be sure to prominently display them on your website.\n- Convey thought leadership. Show your buyers that you don’t just “talk the talk.” The best way to persuade visitors that your firm is a thought leader in its field is through content. Develop a library that includes blogs, checklists, research studies, buying guides and so on. If you haven’t yet produced original content, consider how you might leverage third-party content from a credible industry leader.\n- Don’t be shy about awards, accolades, extra credentials. Industry awards, certifications or honorable mentions are another great way to build trust for website visitors. Highlighting company awards or showcasing your employees' individual credentials are also a great way to show off your service specializations. Display these on your website where they can’t be missed!\n3. Don’t Just Sell Services, Sell Relationships\nWhen buyers are comparing your services side by side with your competitor, they may sound pretty darn similar. It’s the humans providing those services that differentiate your company. Find ways to make those human-to-human, or H2H, relationships shine when promoting your brand.\nIn your marketing materials, don’t just tell visitors how awesome you are -- show them! Your social channels are a great platform to emphasize your company culture and give prospects a peek behind the scenes.\nOn your website, use photography of real employees versus the same stock photos they’ll see everywhere else. Create a fun and engaging About Us page that not only highlights employees’ individual talents, but adds a little personal flair.\nYou’ll also want to promote testimonials that speak not only to the great services your company provided, but the meaningful partnerships that were formed.\n4. Package Your Service Levels\nYour buyers recognize the need for your services, but they may have little understanding about how they will consume that service and what exactly they will get out of their investment.\nSo make it easier for them by “productizing” those services. Package them up to show what’s included at each level, separate them into tiers, give them a name, and offer them at varying price points (or price ranges).\nThis strategy helps your visitors better understand your services and what services they’ll receive or NOT receive for their investment. It’s also a good starting framework for a sales conversation. Additionally, showing this information on your website will help you “pre-qualify” prospective buyers on the basis of price.\n5. Ease In Prospects with Entry-Point Services\nEven if you’re employing all of the right marketing strategies, buyers may inevitably have doubts about jumping in. So how can you cater to the skeptic?\nHelp your on-the-fence prospects overcome doubts by offering an entry-point service, whether it’s a free assessment or a small starter project. This strategy -- offering a small bite before having them commit to the full meal -- can be especially effective for high-ticket services where pricing may be a barrier.\nThat said, if your professional services company doesn’t typically don’t lose a deal on price alone, this strategy is still extremely viable. The real value is that it gives both sides a little time to assess the chemistry of a potential partnership. By offering a defined first step with deliverable that’s easy to understand, it allows both sides to get some first-hand insight into how the other one works -- and for your firm to show off its expertise!\nHere’s an example. A financial firm wants to use a marketing agency to invest in content marketing. They are ready to invest in a keyword-driven content strategy that includes blogs, buying guides and other thought-leadership content. Knowing little about inbound marketing, how can the financial firm assess the agency’s expertise? A solution might be for the marketing agency to offer a defined first step: a keyword research analysis and content roadmap such as a 6-month editorial calendar.\n6. Expand Services Offerings Through Partnerships\nYou can’t be the expert in everything, nor should you try to be!\nAfter all, study after study shows that specialization is a critical component of your professional services business, and therefore a powerful competitive differentiator. In fact, for professional services companies, the fastest-growing firms tend to be within a particular niche.\nA partnership gives your organization the best of both worlds. Teaming up with partners who offer tangential services (for example, a financial advisory firm partnering with a tax advisory firm) opens the door to a range of co-marketing opportunities that broaden your reach and expand your customer base.\nWithin the realm of inbound marketing, some of the ways to do this might include:\n- Hosting a webinar that combines your partnership’s expertise\n- Creating a co-branded landing page for a content offer -- then qualifying those leads and dividing them accordingly with your partner\n- Contributing to blogs on your partner’s site that speak to your specialized areas of expertise (and link back to your site)\nFor more ideas and how to execute them from start to finish, don’t miss HubSpot’s Guide to Co-Branding Marketing Campaigns.\n7. Revisit Lost Opportunities: Re-engage Past or Inactive Prospects\nDid you talk to a promising lead a year ago, but the timing wasn’t right? Maybe a lead was interested in a service that you didn’t offer at the time, but you do now? Or perhaps a prospect chose another service provider, but isn’t happy with that engagement?\nThere are a number of different scenarios here, but the idea is the same: past opportunities can be fertile ground for cultivating new business. Consider re-engaging them!\nThere are a number of ways to do this, and it depends on the circumstances. It could mean anything from adding select contacts to your newsletter list (assuming they didn’t unsubscribe), to sending a one-to-one email, to suggesting a phone call to talk about their business and uncover new opportunities where you may be able to help.\nMore ideas in B2B Win! How to Re-engage Past Customers and Prospects, which lays out a 12-step method for how to tackle re-engagement.\n8. Create Referral Opportunities for Your Services\nNot surprisingly, the #1 way a buyer discovers a new professional services firm is by asking another person for a referral. According to the Hinge Research report, this accounts for up to 71% of new business.\nA structured referral program is critical. It’s more than just a name drop or an email intro. Think about how to custom engineer a marketing environment that makes it easy for someone to refer you.\nFirst, identify who you would like to be referred to. Do your homework! Look at LinkedIn profiles, explore those connections, and learn the names of companies that fit your target buying profile.\nNext, be sure to approach someone with a very specific ask -- Hi Karen, could you please introduce me to Greg this week? Don’t be shy about following up if you don’t hear back the first time -- such introductions serve as an implied endorsement for you, making them extremely valuable.\nYou also want to make your request as easy and actionable as possible. For example, if you are looking for an email introduction to a contact, supply your contact with an email script where he or she can simply fill in the blanks.\nLearn more about how to structure your referral program in our guide: The 5-Step Referral Marketing Technique (That Actually Works)\n9. Work With Professional Services Marketing Experts\nIt goes without saying that the more time and attention you put in to attracting and converting leads, the more gains you’ll see. Easier said than done, right? Devoting time and attention to marketing is a perpetual challenge for many service firms who are focused on what they’re best at; that is, providing exceptional services.\nIf this sounds like a familiar scenario, outsourcing to a professional services marketing agency may be a smart way to go.

Monkeys and “we’ve always done it this way”\n2. Five deadly sins of traditional strategy\n3. Strategy as a folk remedy for back pain\n4. A much simpler yet still effective approach\n5. CEO Uncomfortable Questions\nMonkeys and “we’ve always done it this way”\nImagine a cage with five monkeys and a ladder leading to a bunch of bananas. Every time a monkey tries to climb up for a snack, the scientists drench the other four with ice-cold water.\nThe monkeys soon get the hint. Before long, anyone even looking at that ladder gets a collective beatdown.\nThen, the researchers swap one of the old-timers for a rookie. The new guy sees the bananas, goes for the prize, and—BAM!—gets beaten up by the group.\nHe retreats to the corner, nursing his bruises and utterly confused about what he did to deserve that.\nThen the scientists replace other monkeys, one by one. Eventually, you’re left with five monkeys who have never felt a single drop of cold water in their lives. Yet, they continue to savagely stomp on anyone who dares to touch the ladder.\nYou won’t find any monkeys in a boardroom. But you’ll still see people getting shut down just for straying from ‘the way we’ve always done things here.’\nMany walls stand between us and new knowledge, but the tallest is built by our own experience. Knowledge lives as long as there is doubt; but once forged in experience, it becomes an axiom.\nStrategy theory has become such an axiom. It’s high time to challenge it. After all, this is a club for thinkers, not corporate monkeys.\nFive deadly sins of traditional strategy\nSome medieval mystics tried to define God through negation. Their logic was simple: by stripping away what God is not— a person, light, or an object — they hoped to find the Truth.\nModern strategy discourse, ranging from academic scholars to the self-proclaimed wisdom of LinkedIn, has also enlightened us as to what strategy is not. We’ve learned that it’s not a plan, a 200-page deck, or a goal. A pity, then, that we haven’t been as lucky in discovering what it actually is.\nIt’s not that theorists haven’t tried. But the results are grim: up to 90% of strategies still fail.\nIf an elevator fails to get you to your floor 9 times out of 10, wouldn’t it be smart to take the stairs?\nI could write volumes on the flaws of traditional strategy theory. But I value your time, so I’ll stick to the essentials.\n1. Treating strategy as a mere “set of choices.”\nThey’ve told us that ‘strategy is a set of choices.’ This implies—explicitly or implicitly—that there is a finite list of options, and our only job is to pick the right one. But business isn’t Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\nStrategy is about creation, not just selection. We must create new value for our customers, employees, and partners. By doing so, we earn the chance to create value for our shareholders, too.\nIf a CEO is merely picking the best ‘strategic initiative’ from a list of options, they’re like an actor selecting a role. If you want to be a legendary CEO, write the script.\nSeeing strategy as a “set of choices” drags us back to the 1980s—to the idea of a “market” that we must “win.” But as we’ve discussed before, we should ditch the term “market” altogether. The goal of a business is to create a customer—or better yet, a Patron.\n2. Measuring success by adherence to the plan.\nUnpopular opinion: If everything went exactly according to plan, you’ve made a mistake somewhere.\nToday, the standard way to judge a strategy is to compare results against the original plan. To me, if they match perfectly, it’s a disaster.\nIt means neither the strategy nor the company has evolved along the way. The leaders acted as “corporate monkeys”—experts at moving the needle, but too busy to look up and reflect.\n3. Centering the strategy on the business instead of the customer.\nRoger Martin recently defined strategy as making choices to change customer behavior for the firm’s benefit.\nMy reaction? Facepalm.\nA perfect definition for a $25 online course titled: ‘How to Milk Your Customers Dry.’\nProfit isn’t a goal. It’s a ‘performance bonus’ customers award you for your hard work of creating value.\nWhen leaders write with their left hand that they aim to ‘make the world a better place,’ while their right hand is busy chasing market cap, they suffer from a severe case of corporate schizophrenia.\n4. Hallucinating a predictable path from A to B\nNo matter what theorists write about strategy, they always mean the same: strategy is a path from A to B.\nBut anyone living in the real world—rather than the imaginary universe of Roger Martin’s namesake, George R.R. Martin—knows that predicting where B is, let alone how to get there, is a total hallucination.\nCompared to this, ChatGPT’s cute little errors are child’s play.\n5. Assuming strategy is a proven science\nAnd, finally, no one has ever proven that strategy works. Yes, I mean that.\nThe cherry-picked studies so beloved by HBR don’t count. They are usually written by people whose toughest decision in life has been choosing which wine to pair with dinner.\nBesides, there isn’t a shred of evidence that guys like Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, or Elon Musk ever used a SWOT analysis or a BCG matrix to build their empires.\nStrategy has become the corporate equivalent of a folk remedy for back pain: it has never been clinically proven, but everyone believes it works, so they keep using it.\nAre you ready to try something new?\nA much simpler yet still effective approach\nYou don’t need a strategy. You need to think and act strategically.\nAt its core, strategy is simply an agreement between you and your team about what you do—and, more importantly, what you don’t.\nIf your business is small, this agreement can be jotted down on a napkin over a beer. If it’s bigger, you need some kind of document.\nWhat if I offered you a much simpler yet still effective approach?\n1. Using directions instead of strategic goals\nForget strategic goals. They do more harm than good.\nPick a direction for your business to grow. Base it on your mission and the Big Customer Problem you’re here to solve.\nFor instance: We grow by building and refining [your core products] for [your core customers] to solve their [Big Customer Problem] in [your target markets].\nSound like a slogan? Perhaps. But “achieving market leadership in the rubber duck industry by 2028” sounds like a pipe dream.\n2. Determining the pace of change instead of meeting artificial KPIs.\nI recommend setting the pace of growth—say, 20% per year—but stay flexible if you move slower.\nQuality over quantity. If you need to slow down or even stop for a while—do it.\nChasing a fixed goal often means pursuing a fantasy that may have nothing to do with reality.\nI’m not saying you must banish goals entirely. But if you do use them, keep these three traps in mind:\nNo matter how ambitious the goal, you might be capable of more. But if you set a fixed goal—say, 20% per year—you subconsciously shut out opportunities for 50% growth.\nRigid goals create rigid businesses.\nIf everything went exactly according to plan, you’ve made a mistake somewhere.\nWhen you use a direction instead of a goal, and stop seeing targets as vows, you keep more doors open.\n3. Using Big Customer Problems instead of Winning Aspirations\nStarting with ‘winning aspirations’ creates ‘me-me-me’ strategies.\nStop dreaming about how much money you’ll earn. Start thinking about how much value you can create for your customers—the profit will follow naturally.\nCompare two versions of a corporate vision:\nA. We’ll become an international leader in [Industry] by 2030.\nB. We’ll solve [Big Customer Problem] for [X] million people by 2030 and build a high-growth business around that impact.\nWhich one will work better?\n4. Using Assets and Processes instead of ‘strategic initiatives’\nMany strategies rely on lists of ‘strategic initiatives.’ This approach can certainly work, but I find a more direct path often gets us there faster.\nI like to focus on one core question: ‘Which assets and processes should you change or build from scratch to deliver value and solve the Big Customer Problem?’\n5. Using Navigational Principles instead of pre-set decisions\nInstead of trying to decide everything in advance, my clients set principles that let them make the right calls day after day.\nWhich customers do we prioritize?\nWhich products do we develop first?\nWho do we hire?\nWhich processes do we automate?\nStrategic principles are answers to 30–40 questions like these—the ones that let leaders across the company make day-to-day decisions.\nCEO Uncomfortable Questions\nDo your key people know exactly which Big Customer Problem you are solving?\nHow often are you forced to move the goalposts? If you’re constantly revising your strategic goals, is the constant rewriting actually worth the effort?\nDo you have Navigational Principles that empower your team to make the right calls every single day?\nAre you crystal clear on which Assets and Processes you must build or fix first?\nConclusion: Customer-Axis Framework\nThe No Strategy Approach is part of my Customer-Axis Framework. It’s the result of my real-world mileage: 13 years leading as a CEO, 12 years serving on boards, and a decade spent in business consulting.\nThis approach has been proven across dozens of successful projects worldwide. Its power lies in its clarity and elegant simplicity—an antidote to the over-engineered strategies that usually just collect dust.\nIt’s built on a few core principles:\nThe customer is your only source of revenue and growth. Period. This means the primary goal of any business is to create a customer—or what I call a Patron.\nGrowth isn’t a project; it’s a process. You don’t “do” growth once a quarter. You create and refine customer value every single day.\nAny decision that helps you deliver more unique value to your Patrons and stakeholders is strategy.\nMy definition of strategy: Strategy is a set of coordinated actions to maximize value for all stakeholders, including customers and shareholders.\nIt’s as simple as that.\nEvery Tuesday, I share how the Customer-Axis Framework can make your business stronger. Stay tuned!\nNext Tuesday, I’ll share how processes fuel your Growth Metabolism.",

    "content": "Atom Bank’s decision to shift its workforce to a four-day week will be of interest not only to a few HR professionals but also in every boardroom in the land. The digital bank has moved the bulk of its 430-strong workforce to a Monday-to-Thursday working week. And, this is the clincher, for no loss of pay.\nStaff will receive the same salary for working four 8.5-hour days as they used to get for five 7.5-hour days. Welcome to the three-day weekend, plus the sweetener of sweating away three and a half fewer hours a week.\nThe four-day week has been a dream for years, but was rarely regarded as viable except among the occasional think-tank economist, who wasn’t always overly concerned about the bottom line or staying globally competitive. Or the preference of more pay over more leisure time.\nA few very small employers have moved to four-day working and some big employers, including Unilever and Wm Morrison, are conducting pilot projects. But Atom believes it is the biggest UK employer so far to shift to four days as its default position.\nAtom, which is based in Durham, is an interesting and promising business, pioneering the idea of a branchless savings and mortgages bank. Customers conduct all their business on digital devices. It was one of the favourite ventures of Neil Woodford, the star fund manager whose fortunes went so badly wrong in 2019.\nThere have been some setbacks, but the bank appears to be on the road to success, reporting its first quarter of profitability in the three months to September. Lending is growing strongly, the net interest margin is widening and the company has more than 180,000 customers.\nNor is it starry-eyed or uncommercial. It hopes to float in 2022 or 2023 and needs to show a promising profit growth trajectory. It has hard-nosed backers, including Toscafund, the private equity group, and BBVA, the Spanish bank. Mark Mullen, the chief executive, used to run First Direct. He is adamant that this is a commercial decision that will make for a more efffective business and ultimately will boost returns for shareholders.\nBut what every business leader will wonder is how the numbers stack up. On the face of it, the bank will need a 10 per cent increase in productivity simply to stand still. Is that realistic?\nYes, says Mullen, saying that this is partly about the tight nature of the labour market in general and the supply of IT talent, Atom’s lifeblood, in particular. More than 140 of his staff are IT workers, constantly updating the platform, and the app is at the heart of the business.\nHe needs to stem the attrition rate of his workforce, which typically oscillates in the 7.5 per cent to 17.5 per cent range and is near the top of that range right now. At present he has vacancies for 65 roles, or 15 per cent of his workforce. That is a big drag on any business, crimping its handling of day-to-day stuff and its ability to grow.\nStaff resignations are expensive and consume huge amounts of management time. Output and quality can suffer as recruits have to be hired, vetted, trained, managed and familiarised with their new jobs. Defections can be even costlier if the talent shifts to a competitor.\nProductivity in IT-enhanced, high-growth platform businesses is a weird thing and hard to measure. It’s not a question of counting the widgets per hour coming off a production line. IT departments have their own arcane language to describe their output of “story points” and “sprints” to determine how they are doing. It is not as scientific as it sounds. This clunky measure of productivity is not the same as effectiveness, let alone real progress for the customer or the business.\nMullen is gambling that a more stable, loyal and contented workforce will help to make the organisation more truly effective and will more than offset the reduction in actual hours spent in front of a screen. That certainly seems plausible in the era dubbed The Great Resignation.\nGood workers now can be picky if they are in the right industries or have the right skills. Unemployment is close to its lowest in 45 years and vacancies are running at a record 1.2 million. The desire for more downtime has, if anything, been intensified by the pandemic.\nIt’s dangerous to extrapolate too much from a single company, but this does feel like the beginning of a wider trend, though only in those industries where supply and demand so favours employees. Office workers toiling from home have tasted the sweetness of domesticity and many, though not all, want more of it, and certainly less commuting.\nAlan Jope, chief executive of Unilever, says that one of the commonest questions he is asked by colleagues worldwide is how the four-day working experiment in New Zealand is going. Even the most dedicated Unilever-ite finds the prospect of three-day weekends more intoxicating than the latest Magnum sales figures.\nPolicymakers can sniff potential votes in all this. The Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn included a four-day week in its 2019 manifesto and the Scottish government has more recently allocated £10 million to a pilot project to help employers to shift to four-day weeks. The Tories are more sceptical, pointing out how reduced hours would cripple the NHS.\nThere is, of course, a gulf between a whizzy, scalable fintech and the majority of employers grappling to provide physical products and services to consumers 24/7. Most employers in the traditional economy will utter a hollow laugh at the notion they could afford to cut staff hours by 10 per cent while maintaining pay.\nSadly, the iron laws of productivity are unyielding. If fewer hours are worked without a commensurate rise in output per hour, then someone eventually loses out — either the customer, the employee or the shareholder. Even Atomic law doesn’t alter that.\nPatrick Hosking is Financial Editor of The Times",

    "title": "Six Ways to Improve Your Management Meetings",
    "domain": "dave-bailey.com",
    "age": "264 days ago",
    "content": "Six Ways to Improve Your Management Meetings\nWritten by Dave Bailey\nYour management meeting is one of the most expensive regular meetings in your business. Here’s how to make it one of your most valuable.\nEarlier this year, I started observing the management meetings of some of my fastest-growing CEOs.\nThe companies they lead range from 50 to 500 employees—but each of the CEOs had similar concerns about their meetings:\n- “They feel superficial”\n- “My managers don't engage or challenge each other enough”\n- “I leave feeling anxious, with more questions than answers”\nAfter each meeting, I played back my observations to the CEO, along with suggestions to improve engagement and effectiveness. Surprisingly, the same issues came up again and again.\nHere are six of the most common opportunities that might apply to your management meetings.\n1) Reduce the number of attendees (for depth)\nAs your company grows, it’s typical for your management meeting to grow with it. During my observations, I attended management meetings with up to 20 managers… and they were as unengaging as they sound (even the CEO agreed!).\nThere’s a clear incentive to invite more people—you don’t have to fill them in later. However, the longer the attendee list, the lower your ability to go beyond superficial updates and hold people accountable.\nIf you have more than eight managers, it might be time to ask some hard questions:\n- What is the goal of this meeting?\n- What is the minimal viable audience to achieve it?\n- Which execs may need to step out?\nAsking certain managers to step out could feel uncomfortable—particularly as they may take this personally. But this isn’t a reason to avoid it. Speak to each one candidly and compassionately, communicate to the wider team, and work out how they will stay in the loop.\nLearn new skills every week ->\n2) Improve your tech (for engagement)\nInternational teams and new expectations about work mean that hybrid meetings—with some attendees in the room and others joining remotely—are here to stay. Yet it’s easy to underestimate the importance of a good tech setup.\nDo any of these situations sound familiar?\n- Managers all in one room, but only one laptop with audio on\n- Managers in one room with separate laptop filming the group\n- Managers in the office joining remotely from separate rooms (what’s the point?)\nWithout the right kit, you're stuck with bad audio or everyone joining remotely, despite being in the same building.\nIf you consider the cost of a manager's time plus the value of a productive meeting, investing in better technology can prove to be a wise decision. Check out table and mounted cameras from Meeting Owl, Logitech Sight, and Huddly.\nSimilarly, blurry webcams and messy bedrooms may have been acceptable during the Covid lockdowns, but that’s not a reason to live with them going forward. A good home office setup for remote employees is a no brainer.\n3) Ask attendees to prepare (for relevance)\nThe primary value of a meeting often takes place before the meeting starts.\nPreparing for a meeting isn’t merely admin… it’s often the most important work involved in any meeting.\nConsider your board meetings… what generates more value? The insights and clarity that come from writing the board pack and framing the discussion, or the discussion itself? 99 times out of 100, the prep is the payoff.\nLeaders who prepare well are likely to waffle less and take more ownership. Lack of time is not an excuse to wing it.\nAmazon asks executives to prepare memos in Google Docs which are reviewed in silence by everyone at the start of the meeting. Not only does this ‘silent meeting’ ensure adequate prep, it also guarantees the prep is actually read.\nIf this is too heavy-handed, ask each manager to prepare a ‘PPP’ before the meeting:\n- Progress: What’s now done? What did you learn?\n- Priorities: What’s the next big result? What must wait?\n- Problems: What needs flagging? What’s your proposal?\nThis format can ensure people adopt a growth mindset, stay focused on results, and ask for the help they need.\n4) Have a facilitation plan (for clarity)\nThe word facilitation comes from the Latin word for word ‘easy’. A facilitator’s job is to make the management meeting easier. Initially, a founder often facilitates (runs) the meeting, but as the company grows this role may fall to the COO or Chief of Staff.\nA strong facilitator should:\n- Assign roles: “Who’s taking notes?”\n- Stop waffle: “What’s the bottom line?”\n- Clarify meaning: “Explain it like we’re toddlers.”\n- Surface questions: “What question aren’t we asking?”\n- Drive engagement: “Gemma, what’s your perspective?”\n- Prompt decisions: “You need to make a decision.”\n- Clarify commitments: “What will you commit to by next time?”\n- Set up breaks: “It’s time for a five-minute break… see you at 10:50.”\n- Stick to the agenda: “Let’s park this and refocus on the agenda.”\n- Start and end on time: “ELMO… enough, let’s move on.”\nOne common question I’d often hear was “how are you getting on?”\nThis encourages people to launch a monologue and provide a lot of irrelevant detail. Asking a more specific question often leads to a clearer and more concise answer:\n- “What’s the most important thing you achieved last week?”\n- “What are your key priorities this week?”\nAnd here’s my favourite question to ‘end strong’:\n“What will you commit to doing by our next meeting?”\n5) Normalise vulnerability (for support)\nIf you want to optimise for transparency, collaboration and team spirit, you need teammates to feel comfortable sharing their challenges and setbacks.\nHere, I noticed a couple of interesting things. Firstly, meetings that started by sharing ‘wins’ often showed competitive behaviour. And when people are trying to be ‘the best’, they are less likely to show vulnerability.\nSwitching from sharing wins to sharing praise—“how did another team member help you last week?”—switched the focus to collaboration while still highlighting things that went well.\n- “I closed the Nike deal” (competitive)\n- “Anika sent me some useful resources that helped me close the Nike deal” (praise)\nSecondly, the meetings of teams who recently had a team offsite tended to be notably more supportive.\nInvesting in team building really does seem to have a positive impact on a team’s ability to get results. Of course, you don’t need an offsite to run a team building workshop. Organising a team lunch can provide a chance to catch up and build context outside the office.\nLearn new skills every week ->\n6) Get participant feedback (for improvement)\nI was surprised that none of the meetings I attended had a regular feedback mechanism. To me, that’s a mistake—this can often be a quick win.\nAt the end of the meeting, ask each attendee to fill out a simple two-question survey on Google Forms:\n- What did you enjoy about today’s meeting?\n- What could we do better?\nFeedback and small iterations like this can have a big impact over time.\nThe management meeting is your meeting\nA well-run management meeting can serve all attendees, but it’s critical that it provides you with the information you need to run the business.\nThe management meeting serves you so that you can serve the managers.\nWhich of these points hit home? What actions can you take to improve your management meeting? Take responsibility for making it a 10 out of 10, because if you don’t, who else will?\nOriginally published Aug 2, 2023\nHow do top founders actually scale?\nI’ve coached CEOs for 10,000+ hours—here’s what works.\nJoin 17,000+ founders learning how to scale with clarity.\nUnsubscribe any time.",

    "content": "When Decisions You Don’t Agree With Come Down From Above\nOn occasion, a decision that a team leader doesn’t agree with comes rolling downhill from higher up in the organization.\nThose on the receiving end of the decision may strongly believe that the decision is wrong-headed, creates risk, or has significant unintentional consequences.\nPerhaps they have had the chance to argue against the decision but have failed to influence the outcome, or maybe the decision has come down from above as a directive without seeking any of their input.\nIn either case, they are stuck with a decision they don’t like.\nShould the leader be transparent in their opposition to the decision but tell the team they must execute it anyway? Or should they engage as if the decision is their own and risk alienating the team and losing their respect?\nThe answer to these questions comes down to how a leader views their obligations to the larger organization and to their role as a leader. Good leaders understand they are obligated to hold the organization and its interests above their personal choices and those of the team.\nThe very idea of leadership suggests that everyone aligns with what is in the best interest of the enterprise. What is ultimately best for any organization is full alignment behind the many decisions made throughout the enterprise. Top-down and otherwise.\nTo sustain the forward progress of the organization, leaders at every level must rally together around the core values, principles, and actions of the enterprise. The default position is that any decision decided elsewhere in the organization is to be supported fully by every leader.\nLeaders must carry the flag for each and every decision, and that flag must go to the very top of the flagpole. Unless the decision is unethical, immoral, or illegal, the obligation of any leader in the organization is to support it as if it were their own.\nSpeaking with the team about the decision doesn’t require leaders to lack transparency or honesty. It’s all about emphasis and conviction.\nThe team can learn, if it doesn’t already know, that the decision is not one a leader agrees with. Once that is out in the open but not elaborated on, good leaders make a strong pitch that they are 100 percent behind executing the decision.\nThey offer the conviction necessary to convince others that they fully support the decision—because they do, not because they are expected to. “We” versus “They” doesn’t come up for one important reason: the Leader is always part of the “They,” even when they represent a specific team that prides itself as “We.”\nLeaders who violate this obligation and implicit contract lose credibility in all directions over time. Those leaders who couch their disagreement by holding themselves apart from the larger organization, usually as a way of garnering a stronger “We,” will promote the same idea within the team.\nTeam members will quickly realize that disagreeing with the leader’s decisions is both acceptable and normative. Teams with leaders who fail to hold the organization’s decisions as their own will often find it exceedingly difficult to create consensus on any topic where others take a different view.\nLeaders who don’t carry the organization’s flag soon find many different flags within their own team. Disagreement is one thing. Commitment after disagreement is another.\nPerhaps that is why “disagree and commit” is such a powerful principle in many of the best organizations. Great leaders are always more committed to the larger good than they are to the disagreements they hold regarding any one decision.",

You will need someone to initiate reviews, chase managers, gather feedback, analyse data and present reports.\nthe incentives; this team will determine what compensation for A-players will look like and how resources will be distributed to ensure fair salaries.\nthe quality assurance of KPIs; when performance is treated like science someone needs to ensure that the metrics used are robust. The performance team should not set KPIs by which employees are evaluated but act as a “quality assurance” function on how these are used in the company overall.\nWhen you have less than 100 employees, you can get away with a single person - a relatively junior ops manager or a founder associate to set up the performance mechanism and ensure that it is running smoothly.\nAs you grow beyond 100 employees, you’ll need a fuller team to manage existing processes, and to build scale-proof performance infrastructure that will survive as you 10x your workforce. You should consider appointing a proper Head of Performance, who will become a key point of reference for your managers and execs.\nBeyond 500 employees your performance team will need to grow and specialise in two verticals:\nPerformance will keep focusing on KPIs, performance reviews, and other aspects of performance. Good operators will remain the core roles in this team.\nCompensation will focus on administering equity grants, maintaining salary benchmarks and handling the process around raises. The types of resources working in this team can be traditional HR/back-office profiles, but you will need at least one expert on equity grants to manage your growing pool of employee stock incentives.\nAs the company grows even further, the HR department should have a dedicated team for compensation, handling day-to-day operations. The Performance team remains responsible for all core decisions and frameworks around compensation.\nNo matter the structure, you will need a group of smart, hardworking people who will tackle performance holistically. The team should be staffed with strong operators (or ex-consultants), skilled at building processes and analysing data.",

    "content": "“Hmm, I’m not sure of the best way for us to proceed. What do you all think we should do?” Josh*, the CEO of a global financial services company, said those words to his team during a meeting aimed at solving a thorny problem with a struggling product line. Josh was well liked and incredibly smart. So smart, in fact, that the team had come to rely heavily on him alone to solve problems. He wanted to change that dynamic so that everyone felt committed to offering their own ideas, challenging his, and sharing in the work of wrestling with difficult issues. Because of my extensive research on organizational honesty, leaders commonly ask for my help in getting people to be more honest with them. It’s a known phenomenon that the higher you climb in organizations, the more sanitized and fawning the information and opinions you receive become. How can you create an environment that welcomes dissenting voices? Why Psychological Safety Matters… The concept of employee voice — the behavioral science term for the conditions under which people will speak their minds about problems like misconduct or impending setbacks, as well as freely offer ideas and feedback — has been the subject of research for decades. Much of it has focused on dissecting horrific disasters that could have been prevented had someone spoken up (or listened to the person who did speak up). These include catastrophes like the Challenger Space Shuttle in 1986 and the Columbia in 2003, which were the result of known issues that had been raised and dismissed within NASA. The groundings of 387 of Boeing’s 737 Max airplanes due to mechanical issues beginning in 2019 is another example. Although qualified test pilots and the company’s own engineers raised red flags about the new-generation planes, their warnings were ignored by Boeing until two fatal crashes occurred. In each case, somewhere between the offering and reception of employee voice, things broke down, with tragic consequences. The critical element that determines if employees will use their voice is the presence of psychological safety. Pioneered and popularized by Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson, it’s the ability to feel safe acknowledging failure, offering tough feedback, sharing unorthodox ideas, and telling the truth about difficult situations without fear of retaliation. Thanks to her work, psychological safety has mainstreamed into management vernacular. Its importance to high performance is well documented. The consequences of its absence, like the ones cited above, are painfully chronicled. Expectedly, most leaders say they want their people to speak up. And many, like Josh, believe they’ve made it safe for them to do so, having demonstrated the necessary humility, curiosity, openness, and expressed invitation required to welcome their voices. But the data suggests we have a long way to go. Research from McKinsey reveals that only 26% of leaders develop the skills needed to create psychological safety for their teams. …and How Leaders Fake It One problem, as with any good management concept, is that counterfeit versions of psychological safety inevitably propagate. While most leaders want to encourage people to speak their minds, their underlying (often unconscious) ambivalence about actually getting the truth can unwittingly lead them to a performative version of psychological safety. Here are some well-intentioned but misguided attempts at creating psychological safety I’ve observed. Each one sent mixed messages that ultimately reduced, not strengthened, psychological safety. Feigning uncertainty to appear open to others’ ideas One of the best ways to invite others’ voices is to acknowledge when you don’t know something. This demonstration of humility sends two important signals: First, that it’s OK not to know everything, and second, that you need others’ help. That’s what Josh was attempting to do when he told his team he didn’t know the best way forward. The problem was that he was lying, and everyone knew it. In fact, he knew exactly how to proceed, making his invitation feel manipulative and insincere. Many smart leaders like Josh struggle with chronic certainty, feeling the need to be the “answer ATM” for all of their team’s problems and questions. If that’s something you grapple with, acknowledging things you genuinely don’t know is an important step toward making others feel safe enough to offer their thinking. But for many smart leaders, the fear of receiving lesser-quality ideas than their own makes it tough to ask for them in the first place. Josh’s invitation was met with dead silence. When he and I debriefed afterward, he confessed, “They saw right through me.” In the meeting, he sincerely believed he’d done the right thing. His intention wasn’t to be deceptive; it was to elicit their ideas. When I asked why he chose that situation — one where he actually knew what to do — to ask for input, he admitted that subconsciously he was hedging his bets. He said, “I guess in hindsight, I wanted an escape hatch if I felt the ideas wouldn’t work.” Another way of putting that would have been, “If I’d asked for input on something I’m not an expert in, I would have to face the discomfort of considering an untested idea without confidence.” Psychological safety does require some relinquishment of control. You have to jump into the fray of collective uncertainty, which initially appears like unformed ideas and inarticulate fragments of genius, with the confidence that great ideas will surface through the collective intelligence you harness. Josh thought he was ready for that experience but apparently wasn’t. Pretending not to know something to mimic this process is almost worse than pretending to know everything. Both lead to hearing less, not more, of others’ voices. Asking for feedback they don’t really want, then not acting on it Learning to solicit feedback, listen graciously (not necessarily agree), and then act upon it in some way is vital to demonstrating your commitment to psychological safety. If you want those you lead to willingly volunteer their feedback, start by asking for it. Today, most leaders understand this. Unfortunately, many go about it in ways that ensure they’ll never receive it. Here are some real examples of common missteps I’ve seen recently: Waiting until the end of the meeting and then saying, “Anyone have any concerns about this decision? Speak now or forever hold your peace.” (The token ask) In response to a 360-degree feedback report, saying to someone, “I really want to be a better leader for the team. But this feedback just isn’t adding up. Do you think I’m THIS bad?” (Collusion) After being told by a direct report that they were too slow making decisions, the leader apologized, then went on for almost 15 minutes describing why they were indecisive, repeating several times how much they appreciated the feedback. (Neurotic deflection) Most leaders want the benefits of quality feedback; they just don’t want the experience of receiving it. Experts agree that one way to get folks to offer feedback is by being the first to acknowledge your shortfalls. By saying something like, “I know how driven I can be, and sometimes that can lead me to be insensitive. I’d welcome your help in making sure I’m not pushing too hard,” it helps people trust that your recognition of the issue means you want to change. But here, too, I’ve seen leaders twist this tactic. In one organization, I observed Phoebe’s* “admission” of her leadership gaps take the form of a tearful, self-deprecating rant about how horrible she was. Not only did she not get honest feedback about how she could improve, but the team felt guilted into giving her false reassurance that she was a great leader. This simply reinforced the team’s conclusion that Phoebe couldn’t take honest feedback. If you find that you’re feedback averse, get to the bottom of why. Ask yourself, “What’s my worst nightmare about hearing how my team truly feels about my leadership?” Maybe you aren’t as capable in some areas as you thought. Maybe the gap between your intent and your impact is wider than you considered. Maybe they can’t stand you. Regardless, isn’t it better to actually know than to perpetuate the illusion that things are better than they are? When you solicit feedback to appear as though you care, without commitment to changing, you’re fooling only yourself. All you accomplish is convincing people that you’re not capable of hearing the truth — about anything. So, when your team faces something devastating that they could warn you about, the loss of psychological safety your pretend-feedback invitation caused is going to come back to bite you. Responding to failure with artificial compassion Most leaders understand that making it safe to admit errors is vital to great performance, especially in complex work where mistakes can have substantial consequences. So, in the face of an admitted mistake, harsh blaming behaviors like screaming, berating, or being excessively punitive will only ensure that future mistakes get swept under the carpet. But what does responding effectively to failure look like? It requires some combination of caring accountability that protects the dignity of people responsible for the mistake, as well as remedying the error when possible, or at least ensuring that learnings are applied to prevent it from happening again. The confluence of emotions leaders experience upon hearing about unforeseen errors can be hard to completely mask. Reactions like surprise (How could this have happened?), panic (What’s the fallout? How will this make me look? Am I complicit?), disappointment (I was counting on this project going smoothly), and even anger (I warned them this could happen) can make it awfully hard to center responses like curiosity, compassion, and dignified accountability. And when well-intended leaders try to mask those reactions, it creates a foul mix of awkward behaviors that mistake-makers receive just as harmfully as if the leader had shouted and disgraced them. One employee told me, “I wish he’d just yelled at me and gotten it over with. It would have felt more honest. I could tell he was trying to look sympathetic by asking questions and appearing supportive. He said the right words. But he was wringing his hands, his face was tight with tension, and his tone felt condescending and cold, like he was reading a script.” Clearly his good intensions backfired. He had caused the very feelings he believed he was preventing. Suppressing our feelings is different than regulating them. Leaders must learn to regulate intensified emotions honestly, while still focusing on the person and the failure. While admittedly difficult, it is possible to judiciously express your emotions while caring for an employee who’s failed and supporting them through the experience. Trying to disguise strong emotions only discharges them. . . . When it comes to psychological safety, leaders want the best of both worlds: all voices heard and considered, failure acknowledged and learned from, and feedback offered clearly and received graciously. But they also want harmony, comfort, and a sense of equilibrium. The good news is that you can have both — you just can’t have one without the other. The only way to harmony, comfort, and equilibrium is through the messiness of disagreement, the emotional discomfort that accompanies hard news, and the disequilibrium that arrives when failure must be courageously and compassionately engaged. Persevering through that journey creates real psychological safety — one management skill for which “fake it till you make it” definitely doesn’t work. * Name changed for privacy.",

    "content": "Pricing Hacks Inspired by Behavioral Science\nShould you aim high or low when a client asks you to “guesstimate” the price of a project? Most of us know the answer to this question, and it’s thanks to the world of behavioral economics that we have insights into the principles of pricing psychology.\nMany agencies already leverage insights from behavioral science to inspire behavior change among consumers (stop smoking, start recycling), but have yet to use these principles to their own advantage when structuring compensation agreements. Decades of study and experimentation in behavioral economics have produced a set of immensely useful guidelines that can help professional service firms get paid what they’re worth. Following are seven such principles you can apply starting tomorrow.\nThe price that gets named first and earliest in a conversation becomes the reference point against which all other prices will be compared. This is known as anchoring, one of the foundational principles of pricing psychology. In effect, the more you ask for the more you get. Wendy’s doesn’t expect to sell many triple burgers, but it’s on the menu to make the double burgers look more reasonably priced.\nThere is no such thing as absolute value. Buyers need to be able to compare and contrast in order to judge pricing. This is the principle of relativity and why sellers should always provide pricing options. While people can be sensitive to differences in price, they rarely know what things are supposed to cost. William Poundstone, author of the bestselling book Priceless, calls this “price cluelessness.”\nWhat’s scarce is valuable. We can see scarcity bias in action when grocery stores advertise a limit on the number of cans of soup an individual can buy. The result is that the store sells more cans of soup, not less. Placing a time limit on an offer can have the same effect. The other aspect of scarcity is more obvious; ensure that your offerings are as singular and distinctive as possible. In professional services, the ultimate advantage is developing and offering a hard-to-find service or competency.\nFraming is the practice of serving up your price in a way that makes the buyer see it differently. The easiest way to change your price is to reframe your offering. What used to be a 50-cent cup of coffee is more than $4 at a Starbucks store, because they reframed their coffee from a commodity to an experience. Similarly, many of us are willing to pay premium prices in a bar at an expensive hotel, even though the same bottle of beer is available at the corner market for one-third the price.\nThe pain we feel from a loss is greater than the happiness we feel from a gain, even if the two are essentially equal in magnitude. This is loss aversion bias, which teaches us that buyers will work harder to keep a dollar than to get a dollar. When presenting and discussing pricing, gains should be separated, whereas losses should be consolidated.\nSignaling is about the context surrounding how price and value are presented. It’s not only the message, but the messenger that communicates value. Wedding invitations could be sent by email or text, but instead are mailed in embossed notes and gold-edged envelopes. How you dress and describe your offering has an immense impact on the perception of your price. Restauranteurs know that the same menu item can command hugely divergent prices depending on how the dish is named and described. Smart sellers are careful to focus on benefits, not features; the language of value in place of the language of cost. As Rory Sutherlandpostulates, “A flower is simply a weed with an advertising budget.”\nAnd finally, one of the most counterintuitive learnings from the world of behavioral economics is the Pratfall effect. For both people and products, admitting weaknesses increases believability. Acknowledging flaws makes you, your company and your offering more credible and therefore more appealing. For decades, Avis has reminded us “We’re only number 2, so we try harder.” As behaviorist Richard Shotton notes, some of the most successful advertising campaigns of all time are based on this simple psychological insight. Admitting weakness is a tangible demonstration of honesty and therefore makes all your other claims more believable.\nIf your agency is still mired in the practice of counting your hours and sending the client a bill, you may feel that many of these principles are irrelevant. But if you’ve joined the growing ranks of firms who are adopting the principles and practices of modern pricing (a revenue model based on outputs or outcomes instead of inputs), these pricing hacks from the field of behavioral science can make a significant difference in your year-end margins. Let’s remember that just a 1% improvement in pricing can produce a 10%+ improvement in profits.",

    "content": "Subscribe\nSubscribe to The Art & Science of Complex Sales\nI’ve been reading Sharon-Drew Morgen’s latest book, HOW? Generating new neural pathways for learning, behavior change, and decision making, and I’m fascinated by her contention that the right questions can unlock behavioral change that can otherwise be unattainable.\nIn sales, we focus a lot on changing the behaviors that inhibit sales effectiveness. We talk about coaching and supporting the right behaviors on our teams. Yet even when we get all of that “right,” salespeople have a habit of “rubber banding” back to old behaviors, or simply avoiding correct ones, even when they know what to do, how to do it, and why they should.\nMorgen suggests that what’s happening in these cases is that there are unconscious beliefs and barriers that prevent the behavior change. And the only way to actually get the behavior change is to ask the right questions to unlock the unconscious mind to solve the problem in its own way.\nMorgen tells the story of a woman who wanted to lose weight, but couldn’t*. She had tried and tried. She’d been to the doctor, and tried lots of different plans. She knew that eating a lot of tortillas and other high calorie foods was causing her health problems. She knew what she needed to do to change it, and she knew why it mattered.\nShe just couldn’t sustain the changes she needed to in order to achieve what she wanted. Like a salesperson with bad habits, she kept rubber banding back to old ways of eating.\nBut eventually, a wise person found the question that unlocked her ability to change her behavior for good.\nThe question was: What has stopped you from continuing to eat your new foods (the healthier ones)?\nHer answer: I need to have my family love me.\nThis was not the expected answer! But the question had unlocked access to a deeper need that the woman was trying to meet, one that mattered more to her than her health: Her family’s love.\nIn following this lead, it was discovered that the woman was making tortillas for her family every day, and they would all stop by her house to pick them up. She’d hand out bags and visit and hug each of them, and this was her primary source of interaction with her extensive family.\nShe was making 150 tortillas a day, and then she and her husband would eat the rest. She tried to stop eating tortillas by not making them anymore, but then her family stopped coming by in the mornings and she felt unloved. So she went back to making tortillas, and then back to eating them.\nThe next question led the woman to her solution: What would you need to know or believe in order to make different food choices and still get your family’s love in a healthy way?\nThis unlocked for the woman a new plan: Her daughter would make the daily tortillas and hand them out. And on Fridays, everyone would come to her house for a healthy meal together.\nThis plan enabled her to lose the twenty pounds her doctor told her was necessary for her health, and still receive the more valuable good of her family’s love and attention.\nIn NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) terms, the questions got the woman to address a deeper level of change that enabled her to actually get what she wanted.\nMorgen has invented a new form of question she calls Facilitative Questions to facilitate congruent, values-based change directly from the brain. By using these, they reduce the time it takes prospects to reach decisions. In fact, she suggests that we will never get the behavioral change we want unless we learn to do this.\nThe most powerful questions help a person discover their own answers.\nThe key, she says, is that coaches, managers, trainers, and consultants have to stop asking questions out of curiosity, and start asking them out of the desire to help the salesperson unlock their own potential. And be prepared for the answer to be unexpected.\nI am convinced that questions have such power to change things.\nInstead of focusing on solving the problem for them, we can focus on opening doors for them to solve deeper problems their own way.\nI want to share some example questions here, but Morgen feels that they are difficult to convey correctly out of context. Instead, I recommend you check out her book or Learning Accelerators to explore the framework in more detail.\nHow we coach our sales teams has ramifications for how our sales teams perform, including how they interact with and sell to our prospects and customers.\nFor instance, instead of salespeople focusing on “objections” from customers, they can focus on helping customers uncover their own unconscious motivations and beliefs that get in the way of making a decision.\nMorgen suggests that the right questions, structured and sequenced correctly, can take someone out of the usual “superhighways” of their brain wiring into an observer mode that enables them to see the problem in new ways and adjust their behavior for new outcomes.\nInformation doesn’t teach people how to make a new decision.\nSharon-Drew Morgen\nIn the sales industry, we do talk a lot about asking the right questions, but I think Morgen is on to something deeper. I think we often ask questions only for the purpose of discovering information. But the most powerful questions are the ones we ask to help the other person discover their own answers.\nWhat do you think?\n* location 3020 on Kindle\nSubscribe\nPublished October 18, 2023\nBy George Brontén\nBy George Brontén\nGeorge is the founder & CEO of Membrain, the Sales Enablement CRM that makes it easy to execute your sales strategy.

    "domain": "forbes.com",
    "age": "863 days ago",
    "content": "Last week, I took creative license with Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and shared a version I refer to as The Customer Hierarchy of Needs. When customers buy from a company or brand, their primary need is that whatever they buy works. Moving on, they want to trust the company, align with what they stand for, feel appreciated and ultimately have an emotional connection, which is where customer loyalty is found.\nThis week, I want to take the concept to the employees of an organization, and so I bring you The Employee Hierarchy of Needs.\nFirst, to have a good customer experience, there must be a good employee experience. And if you want employees to stay, you must find ways to fulfill their needs. For more than 30 years, I’ve emphasized the importance of “internal customer service,” taking care of our colleagues at work the same way we want to take care of our customers—maybe even better. What’s happening inside the organization with employees is going to be felt on the outside by customers. And keeping employees is crucial to the success of a business. The cost of turnover can be overwhelming in the dollars spent to hire, onboard and train a new employee, not to mention the time it takes.\nEarlier this year, I wrote how to keep your best employees and featured Joey Coleman’s latest book, Never Lose an Employee Again. Money, as in a bigger paycheck, may not be why people leave, but it is why people work. Simply put, people need a paycheck. That’s a basic need, but the best organizations know they have to do more to keep their best people. And when they do, they reap the benefits of more engaged employees who work harder and feel as if they are part of something special rather than just earning a paycheck.\nWith all that in mind, I’ve simplified much of my thinking and broken it down into five levels. So, here is The Employee Hierarchy of Needs:\n· The Paycheck (and Other Compensation) – As just mentioned, the most basic need is that people need to earn money to pay for their lives: rent, food, clothing, education, etc. Other compensation can include insurance, retirement plans and more. It’s important to keep in mind that compensation is a basic need that can often be found elsewhere. The paycheck is at the base of the employee’s needs.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\n· Alignment with Beliefs and Vision (The Culture) – Does the culture you’ve created in your organization align with what your employees think is important? There are reasons that some companies have incredibly high turnover while others enjoy very little. Even before a potential employee accepts a job, they research the company and check out Glassdoor.com ratings to get a feel for their potential employer. Disney is known for introducing its culture during the hiring process, potentially weeding out employees (cast members) who won’t be a fit. Employees want to be excited and proud about where they work.\n· Uniqueness – This is an often overlooked opportunity. What unique talent does an employee have that they can bring to work? Do they speak another language? Do they have a particular skill that can be incorporated into their responsibilities? I once interviewed a server who had been at the same hotel restaurant for more than 10 years. I asked what kept him there. In addition to enjoying the leadership team and the people he worked with, his manager discovered he was very good at video production. So, once a month, they asked him to create a video showcasing the specials and anything else happening at the restaurant. That they “exploited” his unique talent, even for just a few hours each month, was something he loved most about his job. Take advantage of your employees’ unique talents and find ways they can use them in their jobs, and you will get them closer to the top of the Employee Hierarchy of Needs.\n· Growth Opportunities – Most employees want to grow. They want to know there are opportunities to learn new skills, advance their careers and feel more enriched. From the beginning, opportunities should be discussed, and whatever is promised in the hiring process should eventually come to life. When it does, employees are engaged and excited to go to work.\n· Fulfillment – At the top of this pyramid model is fulfillment. In The Customer Hierarchy of Needs, emotional connection is the ultimate goal. If you want your best employees to stay, they must love working for you. That means they love their jobs, they love the people they work with and they love their boss. They also feel appreciated for what they bring to the company. When you can do that, combined with their basic need (compensation), a culture they enjoy working in, opportunities to learn and grow and their talents being properly utilized, you are on your way to creating a fulfilled employee, who can turn into a loyal employee.\nAs mentioned in last week’s “customer version” of this article, I could have written individual chapters in a book on each of these (and I have in some of my books). This article is meant to serve as a primer for deeper conversations within your organization. The concept of fulfilled employees has benefits that permeate through the entire organization and are ultimately felt by customers.",

Things may get tough with the move we’re trying.\n— Scene from The Godfather\nRecently, Eric Schmidt stepped down as CEO of Google and founder Larry Page took over. Much of the news coverage focused on Page’s ability to be the “face of Google” as Page is far more shy and introverted than the gregarious and articulate Schmidt. While an interesting issue, this analysis misses the main point. Eric Schmidt was much more than Google’s front man; as Google’s peacetime Chief Executive, he led the greatest technology business expansion in the last ten years. Larry Page, in contrast, seems to have determined that Google is moving into war and he clearly intends to be a wartime CEO. This will be a profound change for Google and the entire high-tech industry.\nPeacetime in business means those times when a company has a large advantage vs. the competition in its core market, and its market is growing. In times of peace, the company can focus on expanding the market and reinforcing the company’s strengths.\nIn wartime, a company is fending off an imminent existential threat. Such a threat can come from a wide range of sources including competition, dramatic macro economic change, market change, supply chain change, and so forth. The great wartime CEO Andy Grove marvelously describes the forces that can take a company from peacetime to wartime in his book Only The Paranoid Survive.\nA classic peacetime mission is Google’s effort to make the Internet faster. Google’s position in the search market is so dominant that they determined that anything that makes the Internet faster accrues to their benefit as it enables users to do more searches. As the clear market leader, they focus more on expanding the market than dealing with their search competitors. In contrast, a classic wartime mission was Andy Grove’s drive to get out of the memory business in the mid 1980s due to an irrepressible threat from the Japanese semiconductor companies. In this mission, the competitive threat—which could have bankrupted the company—was so great that Intel had to exit its core business, which employed 80% of its staff.\nIn my personal experience, I was a peacetime CEO for about 9 months, then a wartime CEO for the next 7 years. My greatest management discovery through that transition was that peacetime and wartime require radically different management styles. Interestingly, most management books describe peacetime CEO techniques while very few describe wartime. For example, a basic principle in most management books is that you should never embarrass an employee in a public setting. On the other hand, in a room filled with people, Andy Grove once said to an employee who entered the meeting late: “All I have in this world is time, and you are wasting my time.” Why such different approaches to management?\nIn peacetime, leaders must maximize and broaden the current opportunity. As a result, peacetime leaders employ techniques to encourage broad-based creativity and contribution across a diverse set of possible objectives. In wartime, by contrast, the company typically has a single bullet in the chamber and must, at all costs, hit the target. The company’s survival in wartime depends upon strict adherence and alignment to the mission.\nWhen Steve Jobs returned to Apple, the company was weeks away from bankruptcy—a classic wartime scenario. He needed everyone to move with precision and follow his exact plan; there was no room for individual creativity outside of the core mission. In stark contrast, as Google achieved dominance in the search market, Google’s management fostered peacetime innovation by enabling and even requiring every employee to spend 20% of their time on their own new projects.\nPeacetime and Wartime management techniques can both be highly effective when employed in the right situations, but they are very different. The Peacetime CEO does not resemble the Wartime CEO.\nPeacetime CEO knows that proper protocol leads to winning. Wartime CEO violates protocol in order to win.\nPeacetime CEO focuses on the big picture and empowers her people to make detailed decisions. Wartime CEO cares about a speck of dust on a gnat’s ass if it interferes with the prime directive.\nPeacetime CEO builds scalable, high volume recruiting machines. Wartime CEO does that, but also builds HR organizations that can execute layoffs.\nPeacetime CEO spends time defining the culture. Wartime CEO lets the war define the culture.\nPeacetime CEO always has a contingency plan. Wartime CEO knows that sometimes you gotta roll a hard six.\nPeacetime CEO knows what to do with a big advantage. Wartime CEO is paranoid.\nPeacetime CEO strives not to use profanity. Wartime CEO sometimes uses profanity purposefully.\nPeacetime CEO thinks of the competition as other ships in a big ocean that may never engage. Wartime CEO thinks the competition is sneaking into her house and trying to kidnap her children.\nPeacetime CEO aims to expand the market. Wartime CEO aims to win the market.\nPeacetime CEO strives to tolerate deviations from the plan when coupled with effort and creativity. Wartime CEO is completely intolerant.\nPeacetime CEO does not raise her voice. Wartime CEO rarely speaks in a normal tone.\nPeacetime CEO works to minimize conflict. Wartime CEO heightens the contradictions.\nPeacetime CEO strives for broad based buy in. Wartime CEO neither indulges consensus-building nor tolerates disagreements.\nPeacetime CEO sets big, hairy audacious goals. Wartime CEO is too busy fighting the enemy to read management books written by consultants who have never managed a fruit stand.\nPeacetime CEO trains her employees to ensure satisfaction and career development. Wartime CEO trains her employees so they don’t get their ass shot off in the battle.\nPeacetime CEO has rules like “we’re going to exit all businesses where we’re not number 1 or 2.” Wartime CEO often has no businesses that are number 1 or 2 and therefore does not have the luxury of following that rule.\nCan a CEO build the skill sets to lead in both peacetime and wartime?\nOne could easily argue that I failed as a peacetime CEO, but succeeded as a wartime one. John Chambers had a great run as peacetime CEO of Cisco, but has struggled as Cisco has moved into war with Juniper, HP, and a range of new competitors. Steve Jobs, who employs a classical wartime management style, removed himself as CEO of Apple in the 1980s during their longest period of peace before coming back to Apple for a spectacular run more than a decade later during their most intense war period.\nI believe that the answer is yes, but it’s hard. Mastering both wartime and peacetime skill sets means understanding the many rules of management and knowing when to follow them and when to violate them.\nBe aware that management books tend to be written by management consultants who study successful companies during their times of peace. As a result, the resulting books describe the methods of peacetime CEOs. In fact, other than the books written by Andy Grove, I don’t know of any management books that teach you how to manage in wartime like Steve Jobs or Andy Grove.\nIn the Search Market, Google remains dominant, but in social networking Google must come from behind. Will Google soar or struggle under Page? That depends on how effective a wartime CEO he turns out to be. It may depend even more on whether the most characteristically peacetime company in the industry can make the cultural transition into war.\nContributor",

    "content": "Rocks, Pebbles, Sand: How to implement in practice\nYou know the geology-in-a-jar lesson from Stephen Covey: Schedule big things first, otherwise you run out of time (Figure 1 & Figure 2).\nA common mistake is to think this applies only to the size of the work. That is, âRocksâ means âstuff that takes a few quarters,â âPebblesâ means âa few sprints,â and âSandâ means âless than a sprint.â\nThis misses the most important point of work-ordering: Itâs about maximizing impact by not allowing the easy or urgent things to crowd out the strategic things that take years to unfold but are more important than everything else combined. A thousand âquick winsâ do not create durable advantages or fulfill a long-term vision.\nAnother mistake is to think that the previous paragraph is the end of the story. âSchedule revenue-growth stuff, then maintenance updates, got it.â No. Each type of work requires different prioritization frameworks, has different goals, and hide different traps that make you unwittingly ineffective.\nIf you pretend these differences donât exist, your team will be working hard and delivering lots of code-commitsâ âthe appearance of âproductivityââ âbut theyâll feel like theyâre not making progress fast enough, competition will start catching up, and theyâll (correctly) complain that they canât see how their work is connected to the strategy.\nThe good news is: It does not take additional time to do it right. This is an instance of âsmarter, not harder.â You need the right frameworks.\nThree mindsets\nA tabular summary is trite, but itâs a handy reference:\n| Rocks | Pebbles | Sand | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Effort | â¥3 Months | 1-4 Sprints | â¤1 Sprint |\n| Maximize | Impact | ROI | ThroughÂput |\n| Outlook | Long-term | Short-term | ImmÂediate |\n| Scope | Strategic | Tactical | any |\n| How Decide | Deliberate | Analytical | InÂtuitive |\n| Role of Exec | Decider | Observer | none |\n| Role of PM | Driver | Decider | Decider (but engage devs) |\n| Beware | insufficient impact | over-estiÂmating ROI |\nover-thinkÂing / over-planÂning |\nNow weâll justify and explain how to use this to maximum effect, each stone in turn.\nRocks maximize Impact\nDuration: 3-12 months\nRocks take the most time; letâs call it 3-6 months. Long projects are not only expensive, theyâre also most likely to over-run, because theyâre the most complex, contain the most unknowns, and have the most dependencies. So itâs really 3-12 months.\nHofstadterâs Law\nIt always takes longer than you expect, even when you take Hofstadterâs Law into account.\nWell-oiled agile teams will point out they can hit earlier deadlines by adjusting scope and pushing less-urgent items past the deadline. Thatâs wonderful for learning and customer-delight. But the leftover work still needs to be done, even if rearranged, so this doesnât change the magnitude of the effort required to achieve the full effect of the idea. And anyway, there are good reasons why weâre consistently incapable of estimating big projects.\nA team might complete only one Rock in a yearâ âcertainly no more than threeâ âespecially because other work also needs to get done. If you can do only one big thing this year, that thing had better be extraordinary.\nMaximize impact\nA Rock must deliver dramatic, measurable impact, not merely âincremental improvement.â It must be strategic, meaning that it must attack the most important challenges you face, materially advancing the company down its unique path for winning its corner of the market, leveraging existing advantages to reduce risk and to forge a path that others cannot easily follow, and build new durable advantages. This is where teams most often fall short: Not delivering enough impact to justify their investment of time.\nSadly, big projects not only over-run on time, but also often under-deliver on impact.1 These sorts of predictions are famously inaccurate. So itâs even more imperative that we demand an enormous impact: That way, if we under-achieve, it was still worth the time.\nCrucially, and perhaps controversially: Do not maximize ROI.2 Your primary job is to execute your strategy to the fullest, spending the most-possible time on the most-impactful thing. If an idea is less impactful, yet also quicker to achieve, that is not the right choice. When things go worse than planned, that âless impactâ turns into âincremental impact,â and you cannot spend half a year on something so trivial.\n1 Fortunately, on occasion they can over-deliver by an order of magnitude or two; this is always the post hoc story of a successful company, the founders shaking their heads saying they never believed it would be this successful.\n2 ROI is âReturn on Investment,â computed as a measure of impact divided by a measure of effort, resulting in a measure of efficiency, i.e. âvalue per sprint.â (Whatever âvalueâ means.)\nBeware: âMaximizing impactâ is harder than you think\nThe most common problem is executing Rocks that arenât impactful enough. The Rock claims to âmake a difference,â but not enough difference, and after a few years, it feels like âweâre not moving fast enoughâ or âwhy isnât revenue higherâ even though the work from engineering is high-quality and stories are duly delivered every sprint.\nHofstadterâs Law applies not only to the time-estimate, but to the impact-estimate, and thus to the height of the bar that need to set: It must be higher than you think, even when you take Hofstadterâs Law into account. Over-shooting is the antidote to Hofstadterâs Law.\nEven if your ideas arenât good enough, you will be tempted to select the most impactful idea on the list and just do it. This is a mistake. Itâs such a common mistake, it is a clichÃ©: âGoodâ is the enemy of âGreat.â You have to face the truth: Your biggest problem is a lack of a truly great idea, and you must solve that rather than embarking on a long, misguided journey. The team can do Pebbles and Sand in the meantime, thus staying productive, while also helping create and validate better ideas.\nDeliberative decision-making process\nBecause youâre committing so much of the teamâs life,3 and because you have to be so confident that the Rock is strategic and impactful, you need to spend time on this decision up-front. This is not an âagileâ decision, itâs a strategic one. Once the direction is set, the big picture is clear, the mountain you want to climb is identified, then it is ideal to be âagileâ in how you climb it. Execution details are never certain; backtracking is necessary. But if youâre climbing up the wrong mountain in the first place, being âagileâ doesnât help; the result is a team self-managing themselves into a mediocre, unfulfilling result. Although most decisions should be fast, sometimes they should be slow; Rocks should be slow, or at least deliberate.\n3 Agilists argue that if you find yourself part-way through a failing project, you can just abort, because âthatâs agile.â Thatâs true, and thatâs smarter than plodding forward in a sunk-cost refusal to face reality, but on a human level it is demoralizing and ruins trust to abruptly cancel a project a team has been laboring on for months, âbecause weâre agile.â Canceling is necessary, but not free, so you should act as if a Rock is a one-way door.\nUse this framework to select the most impactful idea: Binstack: Making a maximal multi-dimensional decision. This process enshrines âimpactâ as the highest priority, allows other dimensions to participate but neither confuse nor dominate the decision, and produces a pithy, clear explanation of the decision at the end.\nIf youâre not coming up with good-enough ideas in the first place, try these prompts. But also consider whether the real problem is that your strategy is too vague.\nExecs decide, but ideally PMs are in command\nRocks materially advance the strategy, and executives4 ultimately own the strategy. So, ultimately the final decision of what Rock to execute rests with the executive. In practice, however, the PM should be in command of the strategy and the ideas, driving the discussion and the decision. Ideally5 the PM is actually in command, and the executive is happy to play the role of coach and Devilâs Advocate during the decision process, and to sign off on a well-thought-out proposal.\n4 At a smaller company, this means whoever has the executive role, whoever is running all of Product, or R&D, or the CTO, or the CEO.\n5 We wonât cover workplace dynamics in this article, so suffice to say that this is what âhealthyâ looks like, and the further reality is from ideal, the more one or both parties needs to change.\nSand maximizes Throughput\nBecause Pebbles are the Goldilocks of work-items, itâs instructive to leap over them and solve for the smallest items, establishing bookends around the middle-child.\nDuration: â¤1 sprint\nSand are items that donât need to be broken down. Theyâre short, and typically âjust need to be doneâ without discussion or ado. They canât take longer than a sprint; sometimes they take less than an hour.\nThere are a million little things that are individually unmeasurable but that add up to a significant impact. Great user interfaces require a hundred tweaks to attain greatness. High-quality error-handling requires esoteric corner-case unit-tests. High performance is often the result of innumerable optimizations. High-quality code means fixing myriad little bugs, some of which customers never experienced. Continuous, low-risk tech-debt reduction requires a hundred small refactorings. Security patches and library upgrades are mandatory maintenance. Documentation tweaks are helpful, low-risk, and should be done continuously. Great writing in general requires myriad tweaks, not grand organizational âpivots;â most edits to this document change a single sentence.\nIn bulk, Sand is mandatory for wonderful, high-quality software. When you use a piece of software and say, âWow, this is really well-done,â thatâs a result of Sand. While each grain is typically impossible to âmeasure,â ignoring them means we will never attain greatness, even with the best strategy.\nMaximize throughput\nSand has a material impact only when executed en masse, as a sort of opposite to âdeath by a thousand cuts.â Therefore the goal is to maximize how many of them we fit into the interstitial spaces between the Rocks and Pebbles. The measure of success is throughput: How many we complete per sprint.\nWe cannotâ âand should notâ âtry to measure or prioritize âimpact.â Itâs too small to measure.6 Itâs enough to agree that fixing ten bugs this sprint is a great accomplishment, and that our customers and support techs will thank us for it.\n6 It is conceivable that two daysâ work has a measurable impact on some metric. When you happen across one of these four-leaf clovers, you obviously should do it, regardless of whether you consider it Sand (because itâs fast) or a Pebble (because it has impact). The point is to grant yourself the grace for Sand to not have a measurable impact.\nAlso, high-throughput is fulfilling and energizing for teams. It just feels good to cross lots of things off a list. Do not discount the importance of the feeling of productivity and usefulness.\nBeware: Administrative overhead destroys throughput\nExactly because each grain of Sand takes little time, management processes will dramatically bloat the total time from conception to prioritization to completion. Administration is the biggest impediment to throughput, therefore PMâs must ruthlessly fight against the natural urge to debate and arrange and carefully assess and estimate the work, instead of just going about the business of completing the work.\nIf youâre using the same processes to prioritize and define Sand as to define Pebbles or Rocks, the process is wrong. Add up the time you debate the merits, craft user stories, fill out the fields in JIRA, vote and prioritize into this sprint then re-prioritize into the next and the next, and assign and balance work across people. Donât forget to multiply meeting time by the number of people in the meeting. This can easily occupy more time than it takes to complete the item in the first place.\nSand will often originate from engineering; notice how many of the examples above are internal requirements for great software development rather than customer-driven requests. In these cases, itâs often a waste of time to perform the usual formalities like user-story-writing, because the engineers already know what to do, and why. You can observe this waste in senseless force-feeding of uninformative âproper product languageâ and template-filling, e.g.\n| Type: | Task |\n| Priority: | Moderate |\n| Source: | Engineering |\n| Estimate: | 1h |\n| Must-do by: | 2022-03-15 |\n| Story: | As a software developer I want to upgrade npm package minimist from version 1.2.2 to 1.2.3 so that I donât have a security vulnerability. |\n| Linked Goal: | Adhere to corporate security policies of applying security patches within thirty days of a known vulnerability of âlowâ severity and âlowâ risk. |\n| Risks: | Might break unit tests, might require refactoring around new APIs or behaviors, might delay other work scheduled in the sprint |\n| Testing Considerations: | Normal unit tests |\n| Acceptance Criteria: | Nothing changes after the upgrade |\nIt can get much worse, all for something that could just be a one-liner to âupgrade minimist\nto at least 1.2.3\nbecause of a security patch,â and in practice the work will usually be done in a few minutes, changing one line in package.json\nand re-running the unit-tests.\nPrioritize with intuition and desire, not math and metrics\nBecause Sand is largely not measurable, complex prioritization systems wonât produce meaningful results. Fortunately, exactly because they donât take long to implement, itâs typically not important when theyâre done, and indeed many never will get done because we always have more ideas than time.\nTherefore, this is a great opportunity to engage peopleâs emotions, and go with things people want to do. Since delivered-value is near-nil, why not choose things people have energy for? This increases happiness, morale, and often quality. Because people naturally work harder and better on things they want to do, you get âproductivity for free,â which in turn increases throughput, which is the primary goal.\nSelf-managed teams schedule their own Sand\nIn keeping with the rule to minimize administrative overhead, teams should schedule Sand themselves, not debate prioritization with executives.\nIf the management is constantly engaged in Sand-scheduling, something is amiss and needs to be corrected, and itâs always the managerâs fault. Perhaps the team is perfectly capable of scheduling Sand; in that case, the manager is micro-managing, which is the managerâs fault. Perhaps the team really doesnât understand the customer, the market, the technology, or the work, and therefore truly is incapable of scheduling Sand; in that case, the manager has hired incorrectly or not created an environment where the team can understand these things, which is the managerâs fault.\nLittle requests and suggestions are normal; indeed, these will come from all over the organization. But if youâre debating with spreadsheets and virtual-sticky-note-boards, itâs gone too far.\nPebbles maximize ROI\nPebbles are not a âbalanceâ between Rocks and Sand; they are their own creatures. Their time frame is definitionally constrained between that of Sand and Rocks; the more important difference is that while Rocks are strategic, with a view towards winning over the next few years, Pebbles are tactical wins that have an impact in the next few months, attacking the challenges youâre facing right now, or a great feature idea you can surprise customers with sooner than they expect.\nDuration: 1-4 sprints\nPebbles take multiple stories and possibly sprints. Unlike Sand, they do need to have a measurable impact; you canât spend a month or two of the teamâs time and have nothing objective to show for it.\nIt is difficult to craft great Pebbles, because impactful things have a tendency to explode in effort. Anything longer than four sprints invokes the Hofstadter problem of time and impact, and therefore must be analyzed and prioritized as a Rock. If a Pebble starts expanding, you have two choices:\n- Reduce the scope of the idea so it can be achieved in a smaller time frame, or\n- Move the item into the âRocksâ category, where it will be prioritized appropriately.\nIn both cases, you often discover that the impact is no longer big enough.7 Either this means the team needs to get more creative in how to deliver more impact with less effort, or maybe this idea simply isnât a good-enough use of your time.\n7 For (1), reducing scope might also reduce impact, in number of customers affected or in the magnitude of the effect. For (2) the impact might have been great for a one-month project, but too small when compared to other large projects.\nMaximize ROI\nIf Rocks maximize strategic impact over the long-term, Pebbles maximize immediate impact in the short-term. Said another way: They are the âmost effective use of the teamâs precious time.â\nPebbles maximize ROI: A measure of value, divided by a measure of effort, resulting in a metric of efficiency. Modest value won in a short time, or more value over more time, are both great uses of time. What you cannot do is deliver little value but still take a long time.\nBeware the surprisingly high impact of estimation error on ROI\nThe Hofstadter problem is magnified with ROI calculations, so you have to be especially careful, especially with classic frameworks like rubrics.\nFor example, consider a task that ends up producing 20% less impact and ended up taking 50% more time than expectedâ âa common real-world result:\n| Estimated | Actual | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Impact | 60 | 48 |\n| Effort | 4 | 6 |\n| ROI: | 15 | 8 |\nThis item has half the ROI than we originally thought. This is an immense magnitude of error, swamping the signal you thought you computed. Many other itemsâ ROI will fall within this range of error, telling us that the noise from the error exceeds the signal from analysis. Which means the rubric is useless.\nTo avoid this issue, use this framework for performing an ROI analysis.\nProduct Managers decide Pebbles\nYou could argue that the Product Managerâs most important job is to make decisions exactly like this one: Which Pebble will we tackle next?\nUltimately itâs a judgment call: A synthesis of what customers need most, what competitors are doing, what is consistent with the strategy, what is best for company metrics, and what is best for customer delight. Input from many directions is appreciated, but one mind needs to make the call. That should be the mind closest to the customers, to the product, to the competitors, and to the market, not a drive-by decision from a manager, and not a hostage negotiation with engineers who would rather rewrite a whole module from scratch.\nThat said, committing a few months of time to anything is a big decision, which means it should have a sensible justification, and some objective measure of impact so we can see whether this activity is having the desired effect. With âself-managed teamsâ comes not only the freedom to decide and act, but the responsibility to own the results.\nA simple sprint-planning system\nHow can you put all this together in practice, in real sprint-planning?\nSchedule things in this order, skipping one if there is insufficient capacity to make significant progress on it given the other items in the list, or if high-quality stories arenât ready-to-work:\n- Time-critical items, regardless of size. (Examples: security patches, bugs actively impacting customers, critical work for a launch or other event with an externally-imposed, immovable date)\n- One or more stories from the current Rock.\n- One or more stories from the current Pebble.\n- Sand.\nLife is never as simple as that, so hereâs how to manage the common issues:\n- âTime-Criticalâ takes up so much time, we canât make progress on Rocks and Pebbles\n- You have a meta-problem: Your team doesnât have enough time to be effective; solving this is now your top priority. This problem is even more important than your Rock, because in this condition you wonât actually complete any Rock. There are myriad causes, and maybe multiple simultaneously: Is it a problem of individual productivity, of the team owning too many things, of architectural dependencies, of the problem-domain requiring more people, of lacking specialized skill sets, of greater fortitude of saying ânoâ to certain requests, or what? You must diagnose and cure the disease. Schedule sprint time to work on the solution.\n- Starving the Rock\n- Just one story per sprint will cause too much context-switching, and take too much calendar-time. If youâre constantly starving your most strategic item, this is an impediment that the PM needs to address with the team. Youâre probably falling prey to the Eisenhower Matrix fallacy of working on things that are urgent, rather than things that are important. Maybe you need to pause your Pebble for a while?\n- More than one Pebble\n- If youâre truly going to execute on all four sections, you donât have time for two Pebbles at once. Plus, the context-switching is worse for morale and for productivity. The exception is when a Pebble is essentially complete, or will be blocked for at least a week, and therefore you truly do have the time to work on something else.\n- Always the Rock, never the Pebble\n- Because Sand is definitionally small, a few of those items always fit. But, a significant story for a Pebble may not. What if Pebble stories never fit? Consider that this might not actually be a problem, if the Rock is so valuable. Declaring the Rock âthe theme of the next four monthsâ might be exactly what the team needs for focus and maximum impact. It could be that once the Rock is âdoneâ (in the sense of âfirst complete versionâ), you can then tackle a Pebble and then another, just doing incremental (small) updates to the Rock as you continue to learn and evolve its result, rather than immediately tackling an entirely new Rock.\n- Zero Sand\n- Since itâs last on the list, and often arenât even full stories, itâs easy to just never do Sand, but this will result in a poor product and unhappy engineers (as much of their internal work falls under this category). Consider toning down stories from other areas, maybe pausing the Rock or Pebble for one sprint, or even having a sprint devoted only to Sand, as a fun way to get a ton accomplished in a short amount of time and to break up the monotony of the sprint-planning cycle.\n- Starting a new Rock or Pebble too soon, rather than creating more quality and value from the ones that just âcompletedâ\n- With long lists of genuinely terrific Rocks and Pebbles, itâs tempting to start a new one as soon as the current one is complete. But software rarely works that way. Between learning how customers actually use (or donât use) things in the field, completing small items that were originally deferred (so that we shipped sooner and started learning sooner and started selling the feature sooner), and both incremental and significant follow-on functionality, often you need to keep the Rock and Pebble around longer than it first seemed, or at least not start a new one quite yet. This is realistic for great software and a healthy, sustainable pace of work, and this is another reason why our âtime estimatesâ on both Rocks and Pebbles are subject to Hofstadterâs Law, and further justifies our draconian admonitions about identifying and prioritizing that work.\n- Trying to âbalanceâ every sprint\n- Itâs not important that every sprint is perfectly balanced between all types of work. It is important that weâre balanced over a period several months, otherwise something important is getting starved. Indeed, itâs often wise to build imbalanced sprints intentionally, because that means greater focus, less context-switching, and therefore getting more quality work done.\nOf course all this is easy to say, but hard to execute. Still, when we write it down as simply as possible, and try to honor it, weâll make better decisions sprint by sprint, which in turn creates the most impact year by year.\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/rocks-pebbles-sand/\n© 2007-2026 Jason Cohen @asmartbear",

    "domain": "forbes.com",

    "content": "To foster company culture, you have to address the behaviors that underpin your culture. However, establishing new behaviors as habits is no cakewalk. An article in the Harvard Business Review (HBR) highlights the challenge of establishing new behaviors: “Acquiring new knowledge and putting it into practice in the workplace entails significant behavioral change—something the skills transfer gap tells us is very hard and costly to accomplish through purely didactic methods, such as lectures, quizzes, and exams.”\nTo dive deep into an example, I met with the Chief People Officer of UiPath, Brigette McInnis-Day. At UiPath, much care is taken to establish key behaviors and to reinforce and measure them.\nUiPath is a business automation software that enables employee engagement and empowerment. By automating mundane tasks, the software allows people more time to focus on what inspires them. Founded in 2005 in Romania, UiPath operates with approximately 4,000 employees globally.\nPeople-First Culture at UiPath\nUiPath takes a people-first approach, in both its mission and practice. McInnis-Day said, “Our mission and vision is about human achievement. Any company that wants to do that has people at the core, at the heart, and that for me is important from a people-first approach.”\nMcInnis-Day highlighted UiPath’s four core cultural values:\n- Be humble. “We know we're not perfect,” McInnis-Day explained, “and the idea is that we seek to aspire to be these things.”\n- Be Bold: She stressed, “You've got to really get out there and be in front of the action. You have to aspire to make sure that while we have great technology, we're always thinking of improvement.”\n- Be fast. “As we all know, we can miss the market and opportunities,” McInnis-Day said. “We want to make sure that we really relish in opportunities and embrace them.”\n- Be immersed. She said, “It's a word that really grounds people and guides behavior.”\nUiPath Has a Culture Team and Group of Culture Champions Devoted to Scaling and Sustaining Its Culture\nA common thread among great company cultures is that they create unique and inventive approaches to fostering culture. At UiPath, they don’t just lean into being unique, they also back it up with budgets and people.\nUiPath has a team devoted to culture that serve as the voice of the people. The culture team includes a diverse group of people called culture champions. These culture champions help drive engagement on the ground with the behaviors tied to company values. “Imagine having leaders who receive feedback that's unbiased, outside of human resources (HR).”\nUiPath Develops Culture by Developing Its First-line Leaders\nBecause research correlates 70% of employee engagement to management, the way a company develops its leaders can be incredibly telling of its culture.\nAt UiPath, McInnis-Day is highly attuned to the value of first-line leaders. “I read an HBR article that stated that first-line leaders touch roughly 80% of the entire population,” she remarked. “That's why first-line leaders are where you need to focus, especially from a people perspective. It's crucial to ensure that they understand how to manage people, how to design processes, and how to handle tough conversations.”\nMcInnis-Day and her team recently introduced a new aspiring leaders program. They’ve also launched a leadership experiences initiative that includes shadowing, job rotations, and various other opportunities beyond just learning. “We are offering learning as well,” McInnis-Day said, “But it's hands-on, interactive, and geared towards applying the skills.” This newly launched initiative is for all leaders at UiPath.\nActivating Key Leadership Behaviors\nMcInnis-Day was quick to point out that while UiPath’s values are well-chosen, the area on which the company really needed to focus was the behaviors that uphold those values. “To address our values on a behavioral level, we established leadership expectations.” These expectations were based on three questions:\n- What does it mean to be a leader?\n- Why do you hold a higher ability to manage and lead?\n- What does leadership look like and what are the expectations?\n“We've been cascading leadership expectations throughout the organization and measuring it. We took our people's experience survey results last year and focused on three things:\n- Accelerate your growth\n- Build a strategy, mission, and vision\n- Measure objectives and key results (OKRs).”\nMcInnis -Day explained that because clear expectations were set for leaders, UiPath then tied every leader to the OKRs in their direct reports. With such a high degree of transparency and increased communication, the company has seen a substantial increase in key behaviors.\nMcInnis-Day’s Podcast Recommendation for HR Professionals: “Wiser Than Me” with Julia Louis-Dreyfus\nAll of the chief people officers I have interviewed are voracious readers and learners. Asked what podcast she would recommend for HR professionals to listen to, McInnis-Day recommended Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s Wiser Than Me. “The premise is about sharing your background, sharing your journey as a woman, and listening to more senior women who've been there longer with different experiences. If you start to listen to women in their seventies or older and what they have been through in their lives, how they've seen their careers, and what's happening, you can learn a lot about where we need to go. I also think that this podcast is great to link to the people in your life. Are you listening to them? Do you tap into their knowledge at all ages?”\nWhat Excites McInnis-Day the Most about the Future of UiPath\nMoving forward, the number one thing on McInnis-Day’s mind is HR automation. “Imagine a succession plan where all the information on the employees is already there,” McInnis-Day said. “There are talent pools. We have the ability to move people around based on projects or past experiences. Give them the support they need, all via automation, like we do with our onboarding. It's a different world that we have to redefine quickly because employees want choices and have choices, and they're going to want to go where the work is—the best work they can find.”\nKevin Kruse is the Founder + CEO of LEADx, scaling and sustaining leadership behaviors with behavioral nudges, micro-learning, and live cohort-based workshops.

    "content": "Americans are wrestling with stubbornly high record levels of inflation and the costs of everything rising unabated. The wave of layoffs shook the complacency of workers, disproving the workplace fallacy that your company is a family. These and other events, like escalating tensions in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict, have led to mental and emotional wellbeing challenges for many people, impacting how they show up for work.\nAdditionally, workplace stress is also affecting American workers. According to data from Zippia, 83% of workers in the United States suffer from work-related stress, with one in four reporting that their job is their leading cause of stress.\nAbsenteeism, as a result of depression, costs U.S. businesses $51 billion a year and an additional $26 billion in treatment costs. More than half of U.S. workers admit to being disengaged at work due to stress, which leads to a dip in productivity. Companies spend nearly 75% of a worker’s annual salary to cover productivity loss or to replace workers. The primary causes of workplace stress are heavy workloads (39%), interpersonal conflicts (31%), poor work-life balance (19%) and job insecurity (6%).\nA recent joint survey by Workhuman and Gallup reveals that employees are 68% less likely to experience workplace burnout when they feel connected to their culture. Workers receiving social recognition at their organization are 3.7x more likely to be engaged and 55% less likely to seek a new job. It is up to organizational leaders to ensure employees feel connected to their workplace and thrive at their jobs.\nI spoke with KeyAnna Schmiedl, the chief human experience officer at Workhuman, to understand how companies can be empathetic, compassionate and show appreciation and gratitude to workers to improve their mental health.\nWhat Is Social Recognition?\nSocial recognition in the workplace refers to employees empowering and acknowledging one another for great work, while publicly demonstrating appreciation. It can be a powerful tool for creating a psychologically safe and uplifting culture. According to Schmiedl, showing gratitude to fellow co-workers could increase feelings of happiness and life satisfaction.\nWhen employees respect and elevate their colleagues, it creates a culture of excellence. This peer-to-peer recognition is a meaningful way to inspire and motivate a person. They feel seen and heard and know they are appreciated for all the extra effort put into their job. The positive feedback enhances feelings of value, as workers are publicly and individually recognized for their achievements.\nWith the buy-in from the leadership team, gratitude is expressed regularly, as it is a critical element of the corporate culture. People happily share positive interactions, experiences and congratulations for an achievement—no matter how seemingly inconsequential. Social recognition runs the gamut from celebrating a new product launch or a colleague’s birthday.\nSelfishly, it feels good to applaud others, knowing you made someone’s day. Collaborating becomes more pleasant for employees, as instead of one-upping each other, the goal is to bestow honors on co-workers for their wins.\nHow Companies Benefit\nThe goodwill that inspires workers is also a strategic management style. “Giving great recognition is an effective way for leaders to communicate the values and behaviors they most want to see from their employees,” said Ed O’Boyle, global practice leader at Gallup. “It also sets the example for establishing a culture of recognition and inspires employees at all levels to receive and give recognition that is authentic and meaningful, and to do so often.”\nWhen employees are frequently given a proverbial pat on the back or a “thank you” for putting in the extra hours to finish a project, it will lead to higher engagement and worker happiness. Retention will improve with less attrition and productivity increases. Additionally, the study found that employees are more than five times as likely to recommend their company as a great place to work.\nSchmiedl said about companies being defined by their culture, “Our analysis found that when engaged employees describe their company’s culture, they’re using words such as caring, innovative and inclusive.” She continued, “Actively disengaged employees are more likely to use words such as toxic, disorganized and chaotic. It’s up to leaders to decide which of those cultures they want associated with their companies, keeping in mind this isn’t just about their employee satisfaction scores or the tone of the office, it’s a choice that determines if their business is future-proof or not.”",

    "content": "The Five Meetings Every CEO Should Lead\nWritten by Dave Bailey\nWhen your whole company works in the same room, news gets around fast. Impromptu meetings, discussions over lunch, and overheard phone calls mean the team usually has a good idea of what’s going on.\nBut as a company grows, more formal methods of communication are needed to keep everyone in the loop. And when communication breaks down, it leads to a set of common issues. How many of these do you recognise?\n- The team aren’t sure of the status. When actions are promised but not followed up, the team can lose trust that anything will happen.\n- The team can’t see the big picture. Many people don’t have enough information to understand why certain decisions are taken, or what others are working on.\n- The team don’t have clarity on what to do. Expectations are hard to manage, especially when situations change on a regular basis.\n- The team sit on feedback for too long. When feedback isn’t given or received, emotional baggage builds up and weighs on everybody’s minds.\n- The team feel that their work isn’t recognised. Non-visible work is taken for granted, as are the sacrifices that go into making it happen.\nThere comes a point when regular meetings are needed to address these issues. Founders can go from virtually no formal meetings at all, to a calendar so full of them that they have little time left for actual work.\nLearn new skills every week ->\nSo, what are the most important meetings for founders and CEOs and how should you run them to avoid these issues?\nThe CEO Weekly Meeting Schedule\nMeetings are the backbone of communication among a company’s leaders. When I start coaching a CEO, we document all the regular leadership and team meetings, and how often they happen.\nI’ve noticed a striking pattern: I can predict many of the leadership’s key concerns just by seeing the CEO’s meeting schedule. When certain meetings are missing, the consequences are often inevitable.\nHere are what I consider to be the most important meetings to keep information flowing as it should. Every CEO should include them in their weekly or bi-weekly agenda.\n1) Status update (for accountability)\nThis is also known as a planning meeting, a leadership meeting, or simply ‘the Monday morning meeting’. Irrespective of name, it’s when the leadership team can review what’s happened, align on the plan for the coming week, and share their blockers. Team members can hold each other accountable for executing their plans by asking good questions.\nWhen there are just a few people, the entire team might attend status updates. However, status updates don’t scale. As roles specialise, every employee’s update becomes less relevant for everyone else. At some point, it makes sense to split a status update in two; one for leaders, and a separate meeting for the entire team (don’t worry — that’s coming up next).\nIt’s worth spending time on the status update to get it right. If you and your team can leave the meeting with a deep sense of what’s going on, it allows you to step out of a lot of departmental meetings that would otherwise swamp your calendar.\nFinishing the week with a status update may sound plausible, but I’ve found that it’s not a great idea in practice. Most status updates end with a sense of urgency, which is better leveraged at the beginning of the week.\nThe key to a great status update is preparation. When leaders arrive with their metrics updated and a concise report on key questions in their area (rather than making it up on the spot), it buys extra time for discussion and collective problem-solving.\nWhen you have your best people in the same room, you have to make the most of it.\n2) The all-hands meeting (for transparency)\nAs the name suggests, all team members attend an all-hands meeting, either remotely or in person. Leaders give updates on each department, make announcements, and align around the company’s mission and strategy.\nIt’s a great chance to recognise key milestones and acknowledge the team’s hard work every week by showing what they’re working on.\nIt’s also an opportunity for employees to put questions to leaders. When communicating with others, we often unknowingly assume that they have the background to understand what we’re talking about. This is known as the ‘curse of knowledge’. By allowing the team to ask questions, we allow them to fill gaps in their understanding, so they can see the bigger picture.\nTaking questions from the team holds leaders accountable to their employees — and accountability drives better results. That said, leaders don’t need to have an answer for everything and when you don’t know the answer, acknowledge it: ‘That’s a great question and I don’t have the answer. But here’s what we can do to work it out.’\nThe key to a good all-hands is curation. Ask yourself, ‘What is really important that every single person in the company should know about?’ Keep it relevant so everyone is engaged and energised.\n3) One-on-ones (for expectations)\nThe purpose of a one-on-one is to coach individual team members on their personal development by working through issues in their work, and to set expectations on both sides. This might involve reflecting on key challenges, identifying ways to improve, and clarifying priorities.\nIf you use one-on-ones to review the status of tasks, it might be a sign that you’re too operationally involved in your leaders’ day-to-day tasks. Instead of reviewing tasks and telling them what to do, ask yourself:\n‘What are the most important questions I would ask myself if I were in their shoes?’\nThose are the questions that you should be asking. Stay curious to find out what’s motivating their answers — understanding motivation is a big lever for impacting performance.\nAt the end of a one-on-one, you should agree on a set of concrete next steps. If the individual can take them without your help, they must do so or your to-do list will fill up with other people’s action items (a common issue for CEOs).\nThe key to a great one-on-one is self-restraint. The more you coach and help your team find their own answers, the better off you’ll be in the long run. As my mentor once told me, ‘Coach the person, not the problem.’\nLearn new skills every week ->\n4) Retrospectives (for feedback)\nDone well, a retrospective allows a team to listen to each other in safety. A classic ‘retro’ has three parts:\n- What went well?\n- What didn’t go well?\n- How can we improve?\nTo make it safe for team members to be honest, it’s worth setting the expectation that the meeting is not about solving problems — it’s just about listening. Few things will better teach people to keep their problems to themselves than an unrequested solution.\nStarting with what went well helps get people in a positive frame of mind. If you listen carefully, you’ll hear what energises people and makes them proud. As you move on to what didn’t go well, you’ll hear what’s weighing on their minds. And believe me, in a growing startup, we all need to regularly vent our frustrations, so they don’t build up to dangerous levels!\nAt the end of the session, the team choose one or two areas to focus on and make changes to improve the situation. Given that two changes a week equals around 100 changes a year, significant improvements can be made over time.\nThe key to a good retrospective is empathy. We’re all human and we all need connection. By acknowledging people’s successes, hearing their frustrations, and making improvements, the whole team leave lighter and happier.\n5) Friday Wins (for recognition)\nIn a ‘Friday Wins’ meeting, the team come together at the end of each week on a high note. Every department tells — or, even better, shows — something positive that happened during the week.\nIn a startup, it can take years for hard work to pay off. While most leaders understand the value of celebrating the small wins, it’s really hard to do in practice.\nWhen almost everything is either unfinished or uncertain, there’s a fear that celebration will lead to complacency. The mantra becomes ‘Don’t look back . . . keep focused on where we’re trying to get to.’ Unfortunately, failing to recognise hard work can build up into resentment: ‘I work so hard and I’m totally taken for granted.’\nAllowing yourself and your team to celebrate the small wins on a regular basis can help meet the team’s need for recognition and increase a sense of connection. This is more likely to increase motivation than decrease it.\nThe key to a good Friday Wins is gratitude. Gratitude is the antidote to a host of negative emotions. Naomi Williams famously said, ‘It’s impossible to be grateful and depressed in the same moment.’\nHow Good Are Your Meetings?\nImplementing and improving your meetings with the team might sound like a heavy time investment. However, while they can take up 20% of your time, they represent 80% of your leverage as a CEO. After all, your results depend on other people.\nSome companies can get away with holding these meetings every two weeks — but when it’s longer than that, communication issues predictably start to occur.\nMarie Kondo puts it wonderfully:\n‘Anxiety comes from not seeing the full picture.’\nStatus updates, all-hands, one-on-ones, retros, and Friday Wins can help information and feedback circulate as it needs to. And maybe these meetings can make everyone a little less anxious — and a little more focused on the mission ahead.\nOriginally published Nov 19, 2019, last updated Jul 25, 2023\nHow do top founders actually scale?\nI’ve coached CEOs for 10,000+ hours—here’s what works.\nJoin 17,000+ founders learning how to scale with clarity.\nUnsubscribe any time.",

    "content": "Summary.\nDespite challenging economic conditions, companies are still finding it difficult to attract and retain the right talent. That’s one of the takeaways from the most recent U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report, which showed that job vacancies still remain above 10 million as of November 2022. We’ve confirmed that trend in our own work: Last August, when we surveyed 800 senior business leaders, more than 95% of them told us that hiring and retaining talent was one of their top three priorities as they strive to deliver on their strategies. However, those needs are not constrained to the short-term: More than two-thirds of the leaders we surveyed reported that filling positions for lower and higher wage workers is critical for their organization’s ability to compete, both in the next 12 to 18 months and in the next three to five years.",

    "content": "I recently came across a post by Lars Behrendt on LinkedIn that sparked a lively debate. It got me thinking: What if a CEO applied for a position at their own company? It sounds unusual, but for those of us in talent acquisition, it could offer a unique chance to really see how our hiring process works—and where it could be better.\nBringing Company Values Front and Center\nEvery time we hire, we’re showing off what our company stands for. But as companies grow, it’s easy to lose sight of these values. Let’s say your company prides itself on being efficient. But if the CEO faces a long, confusing application process, clearly something’s off. This firsthand experience can help make sure our hiring stays true to what our company’s all about.\nBoosting Our Brand\nOur reputation isn’t just about what we sell. It’s about how we hire. One bad review can hurt, especially today when everyone’s online. Take a tech company that’s all about innovation. If they’re stuck in old ways of hiring, like skipping video interviews, that’s a problem. Plus, remember that every applicant might be a current or future customer. Their hiring experience can change how they see us, so it’s crucial we get it right.\nMaking Sure We’re Attractive to Top Talent\nThe best companies get the best people. And to get them, we need to offer a top-notch candidate experience. Think about it: if the CEO or other another company leader applies and isn’t impressed by the hiring process, will other top candidates be? If the process is clear, transparent, respectful and challenging in the right ways, we’re more likely to grab and keep the best talent out there.\nChampioning Change from the Top\nIn Talent Acquisition, we’re always hunting for better ways to do things. Some might say getting the CEO or any other company leader involved is a step too far. But if they’re checking in on finance or marketing, why not hiring? It’s just as important. It’s not about them taking over. It’s about them setting the bar high, pushing for constant growth, and making sure we’re on the right track.\nIn Closing\nOur field is an ever-evolving landscape, demanding leaders to remain at the forefront of change. As leaders, we need to stay ahead. Getting CEOs in on the hiring action isn’t just for show. It’s a strategic move that can make us better, ensuring our methods match the fundamental aspirations and principles of our company.\nAuthors\nShiran Danoch\nShiran is an IO psychologist with an expertise in employee selection and a PhD in people analytics.

Getting some elements right can make you competitive, but truly accelerating your performance requires harmonizing dozens of management practices and investments as part of a larger, dynamic system.

Investments here are mutually reinforcing, facilitating excellence in key capabilities such as innovation, speed-to-market, and flexibility. Top-performing companies also work continuously to reduce friction, also called transaction costs—the time and resources needed as they do business inside the organization and engage and interact with external parties. These interactions happen across two interrelated dimensions.\nAt the same time, making the kinds of operational, business, and technology model shifts required to drive accelerated performance may also require shifts in how you lead. Are you up to it? Leaders of winning companies understand the need for ongoing transformation and focus their efforts accordingly. Six questions can shed light on where you stand.\nKnowing what needs to be done is one thing. Doing it is quite another.

These companies boast performance premiums more than 12 times those of peers that only use MSPs to reduce costs.\nDive deeper: Beyond the back office: How managed services partnerships drive outperformance\nLeaders focus. Winning companies are 33% more likely than peers to concentrate exclusively on the distinctive activities that drive performance and 21% more likely to engage managed services partners to tackle less distinctive activities. That division of responsibility frees up resources for what matters: building an organization where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, and accelerated performance is the norm.\nBusiness ecosystems and MSPs drive not only revenue and competitive performance, but innovation. We found winning companies with robust ecosystems and MSPs were respectively 2.3 times and 2.4 times more innovative (with innovation defined as deriving at least 60% of current-year sales from products and services introduced within the past three years). And these dimensions create a larger dynamic system in which flows of payments, talent, expertise, and insights enable positive feedback loops for top-performing companies.\n©2023 PwC.

Well, in our Hopes and Fears survey of 52,000 workers, they told us it was primarily three things: the ability to be my authentic self at work, the importance of a fulfilling job, and the importance of fair pay. The good news for organizations is they can actually control all three of those elements. If you think about fulfilling work, organizations can really understand what is causing friction in the workplace. Is it some of our processes? Is it the way we make decisions? Is it work schedules? Is it the technology we've invested in? And how do we actually improve that for workers and the business? If you think about authenticity, do you have mechanisms in your organization for people to raise issues and concerns? Do you have a really inclusive culture where people can be free to express themselves without judgment, and it doesn't impact their future progression in your organization? Are you actually tracking analytics on this to actually make sure that you're progressing people of all different genders and races? And finally, is my pay fair? Companies can benchmark pay externally. They can look inside to understand elements of pay equity. And they can really engage their employees to say what really motivates you in terms of pay mix. So that's the good news. The good news is we understand what drives workers out, and we can understand how organizations can actually keep people engaged and motivated and productive in the workplace.\nBack\nBhushan Sethi, Joint Global Leader, People and Organization\nBack",

    "content": "How fearless organizations succeed\nAmy Edmondson describes three steps leaders can take to create psychological safety, the prerequisite for greater innovation and growth.\nAchieving high performance requires having the confidence to take risks, especially in a knowledge-intensive world. When an organization minimizes the fear people feel on the job, performance — at both the organizational and the team level — is maximized. But how do you make your organization fearless in a way that builds its capability?\nA fearless organization is one that provides psychological safety. But as more and more consultants, managers, and commentators are talking about psychological safety, the risk of misunderstanding what the concept is all about has intensified. In a workplace, psychological safety is the belief that the environment is safe for interpersonal risk taking. People feel able to speak up when needed — with relevant ideas, questions, or concerns — without being shut down in a gratuitous way. Psychological safety is present when colleagues trust and respect each other and feel able, even obligated, to be candid.\nMost workplaces don’t meet this bar — and their performance suffers accordingly. A 2017 Gallup poll found that only three in 10 employees strongly agree with the statement that their opinions count at work. Gallup calculated that by “moving the ratio to six in 10 employees, organizations could realize a 27% reduction in turnover, a 40% reduction in safety incidents, and a 12% increase in productivity.” That’s why it’s not enough for organizations to simply hire talent. If leaders want to unleash individual and collective talent, they must foster a psychologically safe climate where employees feel free to contribute ideas, share information, and report mistakes.\nIn my book The Fearless Organization, I look at how organizations go wrong because people lack psychological safety and thus fail to speak up. Some consequences can be devastating and life-threatening, particularly in hospital settings. Unwillingness to speak up can also lead to longer-term failures that damage corporate reputations such as the scandals that resulted from automobile manufacturers caught gaming diesel emission tests. Fortunately, there are also many cases where psychological safety has led to reductions in accidents and exceptional decision-making.\nIt’s important to note that working in a psychologically safe environment does not mean that people always agree with one another for the sake of being nice. It also does not mean that people offer unequivocal praise or unconditional support for everything you have to say. Psychological safety is not an “anything goes” environment where people are not expected to adhere to high standards or meet deadlines. It is not about becoming “comfortable” at work. Psychological safety enables candor and openness and, therefore, thrives in an environment of mutual respect.\nAlso, I do not mean to imply that psychological safety is all you need for high performance. Not even close. Psychological safety takes off the brakes that keep people from achieving what’s possible. But it’s not the fuel that powers the car. In any challenging industry setting, leaders have two vital tasks. One, they must build psychological safety to spur learning and avoid preventable failures; two, they must set high standards and inspire and enable people to reach them. In other words, today’s leaders must motivate people to do their very best work by inspiring them, coaching them, providing feedback, and making excellence a rewarding experience (see “The Leader’s Tool Kit for Building Psychological Safety”).\nSetting the Stage\nWhenever you are trying to get people on the same page, with common goals and a shared appreciation for what they’re up against, you’re setting the stage for psychological safety. The most important skill to master is that of framing the work. If near-perfection is what is needed to satisfy demanding car customers, leaders must frame the work by alerting workers to catch and correct tiny deviations before the car proceeds down the assembly line. If zero worker fatalities in a dangerous platinum mine is the goal, then leaders must frame physical safety as a worthy and challenging but attainable goal. If discovering new cures is the goal, leaders have to motivate researchers to generate smart hypotheses for experiments and to feel okay about being wrong far more often than right.\nIf leaders want to unleash individual and collective talent, they must foster a psychologically safe climate where employees feel free to contribute ideas, share information, and report mistakes.\nWhen Cynthia Carroll was appointed in 2007, with much fanfare, as the first female CEO of the international mining company Anglo American, she was appalled by the number of worker fatalities that had been occurring in the company — nearly 200 in the five years prior to her arrival. Realizing that she was, as she told the Harvard Business Review, “in an unprecedented position to influence change” as both an American and an outsider in South Africa (where the company headquarters and much of its mining operations were located), she immediately used her position to speak up and demand a policy of zero fatalities or serious injuries.\nAt first, others in the company, especially members of the old guard who saw themselves as upholding tradition, refused to take Carroll seriously. Carroll’s response to the resistance could not have been less ambiguous. She shut down one of the most problematic and dangerous mines. She insisted that before the mine could restart, she intended to find out what the workers were thinking, and she intended to get input from every single worker about how to improve safety.\nAnglo American leadership adopted a traditional South African method of conducting village assemblies, called lekgotla, to help create the psychological safety to allow miners to speak up. During the lekgotla, senior managers reframed the initial question. Instead of asking workers to give their opinions directly about safety issues, they asked, “What do we need to do to create a work environment of care and respect?” In a powerful symbolic gesture of shared commitment, workers and Anglo American executives signed a contract. When the mines reopened, more than 30,000 workers were retrained to comply with the newly agreed-upon safety protocols. Fatalities fell during Carroll’s tenure, from 44 in 2006 to 17 in 2011, and, although revenues fell in both 2008 and 2011, the company achieved the highest operating profits in its history.\nBecause fear of (reporting) failure is such a key indicator of an environment with low levels of psychological safety, how leaders present the role of failure is essential. Astro Teller at X Development, Alphabet’s advanced research subsidiary (formerly Google X), observed that “the only way to get people to work on big, risky things...is if you make that the path of least resistance for them [and] make it safe to fail.” In other words, unless a leader expressly and actively makes it psychologically safe to fail, people will automatically seek to avoid failure. So how did Teller reframe failure to make it okay? By saying, believing, and convincing others that “I’m not pro failure, I’m pro learning.” Similarly, OpenTable CEO Christa Quarles tells employees, “Early, often, ugly. It’s okay. It doesn’t have to be perfect because then I can course-correct much, much faster.” This too is a framing statement. It says that success in the online restaurant reservation business occurs through course correction — not through magically getting it right the first time. Quarles is framing early, ugly versions as information vital to making good decisions that lead to later, beautiful versions.\nThe reframe shows that leaders must establish and cultivate psychological safety to succeed in most work environments today. The leader is obliged to set direction for the work, to invite relevant input to clarify and improve on the general direction that has been set, and to create conditions for continued learning to achieve excellence. In the reframe, those who are not the boss are seen as valued contributors — that is, as people with crucial knowledge and insight. Leaders in a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world, who understand that today’s work requires continuous learning to figure out when and how to change course, must consciously reframe how they think, from the default frames that we all bring to work unconsciously to a more productive reframe. Framing the work is not something that leaders do once, and then it’s done. Frequently calling attention to levels of uncertainty or interdependence helps people remember that they must be alert and candid to perform well.\nInviting Participation\nThe second essential activity in the leaders’ tool kit is inviting participation in a way that people find compelling and genuine. The goal is to lower what is usually a too-high bar for what’s considered appropriate participation. Realizing that self-protection is natural, the invitation to participate must be crystal clear if people are going to choose to engage rather than to play it safe. Two essential behaviors that signal an invitation is genuine are adopting a mindset of situational humility and engaging in proactive inquiry.\nThe bottom line is that no one wants to take the interpersonal risk of imposing ideas when the boss appears to think he or she knows everything. A learning mindset, which blends humility and curiosity, mitigates this risk. A learning mindset recognizes that there is always more to learn. Frankly, adopting a humble mindset when faced with the complex, dynamic, uncertain world in which we all work today is simply realism. The term situational humility captures this concept well (the need for humility lies in the situation) and may make it easier for leaders, especially those with abundant self-confidence, to recognize the validity, and the power, of a humble mindset. Keep in mind that confidence and humility are not opposites. Confidence in one’s abilities and knowledge, when warranted, is far preferable to false modesty. But humility is not modesty, false or otherwise. Humility is the simple recognition that you don’t have all the answers, and you certainly don’t have a crystal ball. Research shows that when leaders express humility, teams engage in more learning behavior.\nThis is an extreme example of how humility and proactive inquiry can work.\nThe Fukushima nuclear plant Daini suffered severe damage when a giant earthquake struck in March 2011, but was shut down successfully, unlike the infamous Daiichi plant nine miles to the north. Naohiro Masuda, the Daini plant superintendent, inspired life-saving teamwork, and his key weapon was a whiteboard. Instead of grabbing a megaphone or commanding action, Masuda began writing things down: the magnitude and frequency of the earthquake’s aftershocks, calculations, and a rough chart that demonstrated the decreasing danger of the quakes over time. He armed his team with data about the risks and allowed them to make their own decisions about whether they wanted to assist in what might be a dangerous mission.\nFrom the beginning, Masuda chose to issue information rather than orders. As the men raced against the clock [to restart cooling systems], Masuda slowly came to an unwelcome realization: his plan was untenable. His strength as a leader was demonstrated by the immediate admission of his mistake. This increased the psychological safety in the team and bonded the group more tightly. Consulting with the team leaders, Masuda added in adjustments to the plan on the whiteboard. Some engineers spoke up about imminent dangers, and the plan was refocused again. Although the team had not slept in almost two days, it committed to the new course of action. Workers restored the cooling action with about two hours to spare.\nDemonstrating situational humility also includes acknowledging your errors and shortcomings. Anne Mulcahy, former chairperson and CEO of Xerox, who led the company through a successful transformation out of bankruptcy in the 2000s, said that she was known to many in the company as the “Master of I Don’t Know” because rather than offer an uninformed opinion she would so often reply, “I don’t know” to questions. Humility can be strangely rare in many organizations. London Business School Professor Dan Cable sheds light on why. In a recent article in Harvard Business Review, he writes, “Power…can cause leaders to become overly obsessed with outcomes and control,” inadvertently ramping up “people’s fear — fear of not hitting targets, fear of losing bonuses, fear of failing — and as a consequence…their drive to experiment and learn is stifled.” Being overly certain or just plain arrogant can have similar effects — increasing fear, reducing motivation, and inhibiting interpersonal risk taking.\nResponding Productively\nTo reinforce a climate of psychological safety, it’s imperative that leaders — at all levels — respond productively to the risks people take. Productive responses are characterized by three elements: expressions of appreciation, destigmatizing failure, and sanctioning clear violations. Stanford University Professor Carol Dweck, whose celebrated research on mindset shows the power of a learning orientation for individual achievement and resilience in the face of challenge, notes the importance of praising people for efforts, regardless of the outcome. When people believe their performance is an indication of their ability or intelligence, they are less likely to take risks — for fear of a result that would disconfirm their ability. But when people believe that performance reflects effort and good strategy, they are eager to try new things and willing to persevere despite adversity and failure.\nPraising effort is especially important in uncertain environments, where good outcomes are not always the result of good process, and vice versa. Although many of the examples in this book present responses from CEOs, an equally important leadership responsibility for C-level executives is making sure that people throughout the organization respond productively to their colleagues. Clearly, good process can lead to good outcomes, and bad process can lead to bad outcomes. But good process also can produce bad outcomes (especially facing high uncertainty or complexity, as in VUCA conditions), and bad process can produce a good outcome (when you get lucky). The lack of simple cause-effect relationships in uncertain, ambiguous environments reinforces the importance of productive responses to outcomes of all kinds, but especially to bad news outcomes.\nProductive responses often include expressions of appreciation, ranging from the small (“thank you so much for speaking up”) to the elaborate — celebrations or bonuses in response to intelligent failure. Failure is a necessary part of uncertainty and innovation, but this must be made explicit to reinforce the invitation for voice. I frequently ask managers, scientists, salespeople, and technologists around the world the following question: What percentage of the failures in your organizations should be considered blameworthy? Their answers are usually in the single digits — perhaps 1% to 4%. I then ask what percentage are treated as blameworthy. Now, they say (after a pause or a laugh) 70% to 90%! The unfortunate consequence of this gap between simple logic and organizational response is that many failures go unreported and their lessons are lost.\nIn fact, a productive response to intelligent failure can mean actually celebrating the news. Some years ago, the chief scientific officer at Eli Lilly introduced “failure parties” to honor intelligent, high-quality scientific experiments that failed to achieve the desired results. Might this be a bridge too far? I don’t think so. First, and most obviously, it helps build a psychologically safe climate for thoughtful risks, which is mission critical in science. Second, it helps people acknowledge failures in a timely way, which allows redeployment of valuable resources — scientists and materials — to new projects earlier rather than later, potentially saving thousands of dollars. Third, when you hold a party, people tend to show up — which means they learn about the failure. This in turn lowers the risk that the company will repeat the same failure. An intelligent failure the first time around no longer qualifies as intelligent the second time.\nIn brief, a productive response to preventable failures is to double down on prevention, usually a combination of training and improved system design to make it easier for people to do the right thing. However, there are instances in which a preventable failure is the result of a blameworthy action or a repeated instance of deviation from prescribed process, impervious to prior attempts at redirection. In such cases, usually rare, there is an obligation to act in ways that prevent future occurrence. This may mean levying fines or other sanctions, and in some cases even firing someone.\nA productive response is concerned with future impact. Punishment sends a powerful message, and an appropriate one if boundaries were clear in advance. Indeed, it is vital to send messages that reinforce values the company holds dear. However, it is equally vital not to inadvertently send a message that says, “diverse opinions simply won’t be tolerated here,” or “one strike and you’re out.” Such messages reduce psychological safety and ultimately erode the quality of the work. In contrast, a message that reinforces the values and practices of a learning organization is, “it’s okay to make a mistake, and it’s okay to hold an opinion that others don’t like, so long as you are willing to learn from the consequences.” The most important goal is figuring out a way to help the organization learn from what happened. And so, if there is ambiguity about public self-expression related to company policies, then a productive response is one that engages people in a learning dialogue to better understand and improve how the company functions.\nThe practices described here are dominated by complex interpersonal skills and thus not easy to master. They take time, effort, and practice. Perhaps the most important aspect of learning them is to practice self-reflection. Building psychological safety is a good place to start building your fearless organization.\nAuthor profile:\n- Amy C.

    "content": "Kill your performance ratings\nNeuroscience shows why numbers-based HR management is obsolete.\ns+b celebrating 25 years: Articles make their mark when they effectively challenge assumptions and practices that are widely accepted. In 2014, neuroscientist David Rock and colleagues Josh Davis and Beth Jones convincingly argued that the most powerful tool organizations use for human capital management was broken. They urged leaders to evaluate people based on the unique role they play in moving the organization forward.\nEvidence is mounting that conventional approaches to strategic human capital management are broken. This is particularly true for performance management (PM) systems—the appraisal approaches in which employees (working with their managers) set goals for the year; managers interview others who have worked with them and write up an appraisal; employees are rated and ranked numerically; and salary, bonus, and promotion opportunities are awarded accordingly. A 2013 survey by the Society for Human Resource Management asked HR professionals about the quality of their own PM systems; only 23 percent said their company was above average in the way it conducted them. Other studies uncovered even more disdain. According to the Corporate Executive Board (CEB), a management research group, surveys have found that 95 percent of managers are dissatisfied with their PM systems, and 90 percent of HR heads believe they do not yield accurate information.\nThe performance management systems in many companies are misleading, cumbersome, and complex, requiring some HR departments to put aside an entire quarter to manage them. More important, they can be counterproductive. In the context of neuroscience research, most PM practices turn out to damage the performance they are intended to improve. That’s because they are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of human responses, as revealed in recurring patterns of mental activity.\nThere are at least two basic problems with performance management. First, labeling people with any form of numerical rating or ranking automatically generates an overwhelming “fight or flight” response that impairs good judgment. This neural response is the same type of “brain hijack” that occurs when there is an imminent physical threat like a confrontation with a wild animal. It primes people for rapid reaction and aggressive movement. But it is ill-suited for the kind of thoughtful, reflective conversation that allows people to learn from a performance review.\nFor example, a supervisor might say, with the best of intentions, “You were ranked number 2 this year, and here are some development actions for the future.” In this company, which scores its appraisals on a 1–3 scale, a 2 ranking is supposed to represent high praise. But a typical employee immediately disengages. Knowing that others were ranked still higher is enough to provoke a brain hijack. The employee may not say anything overtly, but he or she feels disregarded and undermined—and thus intensely inclined to ignore feedback, push back against stretch goals, and reject the example of positive role models.\nThe second problem with PM is that it fosters an incorrect but prevalent view of human growth and learning. As Carol Dweck, the Lewis and Virginia Eaton Professor of Psychology at Stanford University, has discovered, most people hold one of two implicit theories about human growth and learning. The “fixed mind-set,” as she calls it, holds that intelligence and talent are basically established at birth and remain static throughout life. People are born smart or not, and there’s not much anyone can do about it. The “growth mind-set,” by contrast, holds that people learn, grow, and improve all their lives. This is accurate; most people do learn throughout their years. But they could learn far more effectively, and bring more of a high-performance attitude to everything they did, if they weren’t held back by the mental paralysis associated with the fixed mind-set.\nFew people are thoroughly inclined toward either the fixed or the growth mind-set. Some people, for instance, might go to work with a fixed mind-set about their ability to be creative, believing that they can never become any better at innovating new products than they are today. But they might have a growth mind-set when playing classical piano, associating the rigors of daily practice with their ability to improve.\nIf you want a high-performance organization, you have to reverse the destructive effects of conventional PM.\nUnfortunately, the fixed mind-set is prevalent in many organizations—and reinforced by PM systems. This induces many employees to avoid the kind of effort that leads to learning and professional growth. Think back to your days in school. Chances are, no one liked to appear as if he or she had to work really hard to get good grades. They feared that others might think they were not naturally talented. Similarly, in a work environment where the fixed mind-set holds sway, people will typically strive to avoid difficult challenges. Any stretch goal or strategic imperative, no matter how worthy, will be seen as an invitation to fail. Unsurprisingly, this mind-set also makes people more likely to cheat. In one study, people primed just before a test with fixed mind-set suggestions (for example, statements that they could not change or grow) were 300 percent more likely to cheat than their growth mind-set counterparts.\nThe effects on organizations are devastating. Conventional performance management has been linked to high levels of attrition, low productivity, and significant problems with collaboration. PwC’s 17th Annual Global CEO Survey, conducted in 2013, found that 93 percent of the CEOs surveyed recognized the need to change their talent practices—something their companies were doing wasn’t working. Meanwhile, according to Korn Ferry Institute leadership development researcher Robert Eichinger, the ability to “grow talent” is ranked 67th out of 67 competencies for managers, despite decades of investment in PM systems. In other words, on average, managers are worse at developing their employees than at anything else they do.\nIf you want a high-performance organization, you have to reverse the destructive effects of conventional performance management. You need to find ways to evaluate people that recognize the unique role each person has played in moving the organization forward. These evaluations must be based on a growth mind-set: They must recognize that with the right context and conditions, anyone’s abilities can be improved, especially given the expansive, flexible nature of the human brain.\nThe starting point may be educating your company’s leaders about your current performance system, especially if it is based on numerical rankings. Because these rankings are so deeply ingrained in most organizations, and so closely tied to both the fight-or-flight response and the fixed mind-set, you may need to build awareness to get people ready to consider change.\nRanking and Its Discontents\nIn theory, a standardized, objectives-based PM system should be a straightforward exercise. It seems logical to set goals, provide feedback about progress during a six- or 12-month cycle, agree at the end of the cycle on whether these goals were achieved, and link an individual’s compensation to the results. It is also clearly easier to manage this approach with a common rating system for all employees. Thus, by the 1970s, most large organizations adopted a rating system to define human performance. Typically, these ranked people on a 1–3 or 1–5 scale. The lowest number denoted an outstanding performer, and anyone with the highest number was a problem employee.\nSoon, many companies discovered that managers tended to rate everyone in the middle. As one executive from a large food manufacturer (with a 1–5 rating system) explained, “Anything other than a 3 requires extra work for a manager. You have to justify it if you give an employee a 1 or 2, and you have to put the employee in a performance improvement plan if you rank them 4 or 5.”\nStarting with General Electric in the late 1980s, under Jack Welch’s direction, companies tried to solve this problem by requiring managers to differentiate their people and spread out the ratings on a curve. In this system, known as “forced ranking” (or “rank and yank”), a specific percentage of people had to be ranked at the top and bottom ranges, with their promotions and bonuses affected accordingly. A multibillion-dollar human capital management software industry emerged to support this type of system, which became commonplace in large companies, where it was seen as a consistent way to make rewards match performance. As of 2012, according to the Wall Street Journal, more than 60 percent of Fortune 500 firms still used this approach.\nYet both managers and employees find these systems dispiriting and exhausting. Kansas State University management professor Satoris Culbertson, who studied the response to more than 200 performance reviews, argues that the mere act of receiving a numerical rating can be perceived as negative feedback, and even people with a growth mind-set don’t react well to negative feedback. “You would think that having so many smart people try thousands of variations of a [ranking] scale over decades, someone would have found the right way to do this,” says Brian Kropp, who leads the CEB human resources practice. “But no one has.”\nThe SCARF Hypothesis\nWhy do performance rankings trigger a fight-or-flight response in employees’ brains? A neuroscience-based framework called the SCARF model, codified by David Rock, posits that five organizational factors have an immense, but often unnoticed, effect on negative human reactions. These factors are status (the perception of being considered better or worse than others); certainty (the predictability of future events); autonomy (the level of control people feel over their lives); relatedness (the experience of sharing goals with others); and fairness (the sense of being respected and treated equitably, especially compared with others). When an organization’s perceived level of any of the SCARF factors is low, people feel threatened and perturbed. Even if they don’t express it, the feeling is there, and it often impairs their productivity and willingness to show commitment. Performance rankings trigger that perturbed feeling in all five ways:\n1. Status. People in lower-status positions have been labeled with numbers throughout history, as a way of dehumanizing and demoralizing them. In performance rankings in most organizations today, any number except 1 automatically signifies a lower-status position, with pay levels and promotion prospects to match. People carry that number, and the insult implicit in it, mentally around with them for a year, until their next performance review. As Korn Ferry’s Eichinger says, “Imagine getting a family together, lining all the kids up in a row, and telling them how they rank compared to each other.” Parents wouldn’t do it, because it would make most of the family members uncomfortable—including whoever was ranked at the top.\n2. Certainty. The process of determining how people are rated is usually set in the human resources department, and is often opaque to everyone else. People may work as hard and as cleverly as they can, but they still don’t know if this will get them a higher rating. That’s because the rankings reflect not just their individual performance, but their perceived contribution compared to a cohort of their peers. If everyone is performing optimally but the manager can reward only the top 10 percent with the highest ranking, the employee’s sense of control is thrown out the window.\n3. Autonomy. When a student gets a poor grade at school, there is generally a clear path to improvement—a path that may involve studying harder or seeking extra help. Whatever it is, the individual has some control. In an organization, a clear path is not always evident. Improvement may depend on factors (such as customer response to a product or the willingness of others to collaborate) that employees feel they cannot control or even influence. Though workers may actually have more influence than they think, the ratings trigger a sense of lack of autonomy. They reinforce the perception that the employee is neither trusted nor empowered. Moreover, in most PM systems, the focus is on past performance, not on future potential. This sends an unconscious message to employees: Their capacities are fixed and may never change. If those workers have not had much autonomy, or experienced it in the past, they are unlikely to see that change in the future.\n4. Relatedness. If only one person can be given the top rating and get the best bonus, suddenly employees have good reason to undermine one another’s ratings, rather than to collaborate. “We spend performance season getting battle ready,” explains one manager. “Two weeks before my review, I begin to prepare my attack.” In one celebrated case, Microsoft’s ranking system (since discontinued) was blamed for the company’s decline in performance. Although Microsoft did not apply ranking quotas to individual small teams, a Vanity Fair article quoted a programming staff member who clearly believed the company did, and who said, “It leads to employees focusing on competing with each other rather than competing with other companies.” A similar unintended consequence occurs up the hierarchy. If employees feel that their bosses are comparing them against their peers, they will not openly share information that might compromise their ranking.\n5. Fairness. A CEB study showed that at least two-thirds of the people paid as top performers are not actually seen by their peers as contributing the most to the enterprise. Perhaps that’s why another survey, this one from the research firm i4cp, found that 75 percent of the respondents believed performance systems were not fair. This represented a threefold increase since 2008, when it was only 25 percent. Unfairness is perhaps the biggest problem with forced ranking, because the system is set up in a way that makes the decisions seem more arbitrary every year. In most companies, after several years of a forced ranking system, poor performers have already left. Everyone who remains performs above expectations, almost by definition. But managers are still forced to rank their subordinates on a 20/70/10 scale, and the bottom 10 percent are required to leave. Thus, every year, at least one highly motivated, highly capable employee is ranked as a bottom performer. This ends with the employee exiting the company, and the manager deeply frustrated.\nOf course, all these factors reinforce one another in ways that worsen the effect. For example, when people feel that others were ranked more highly without merit, and have no recourse to complain, the combined lack of fairness and autonomy can generate a much stronger emotional reaction than either would alone.\nThe result of all this? People feel unappreciated. They become more conservative. They set their goals low to ensure that they are seen as succeeding. They retreat from candid conversations about development, because the whole issue of progress and feedback is so emotionally charged. The experience becomes one of “ticking a box.” There is little of the type of conversation that actually promotes personal growth.\nThe rating system is particularly harsh on those who conduct the appraisals. Supervisors feel pressure to continue to show improvement, raising some people’s rating over time. They also feel pressure to differentiate, leading them to scapegoat some of their subordinates as poor performers. Steven Rice, executive vice president of human resources at the technology company Juniper Networks, explains why it deliberately shut down its forced ranking system: “The critical practice of letting someone know where their performance authentically stood became hijacked by artificially categorizing individuals into forced ratings in order to meet a fixed compensation budget. The process lost its integrity. In the majority of situations, it rendered the performance feedback incongruent with compensation and the rating. Ironically, an HR process designed to drive fairness resulted in mistrust.... Managers blamed it for tying their hands and wrote the whole process off as unhelpful.”\nOnly one person typically feels neurologically rewarded by the PM exercise. It’s not the high performer, but the senior executive who oversees the ranking system. The feelings of status, certainty, and autonomy that occur when one is presiding over a forced ranking system are intrinsically rewarding. Even the act of categorizing information into groups, according to one study, activates the reward center of the brain. That’s why part of the education effort must include senior executives, who may not see the problem because the PM process reinforces their own cognitive reward while diminishing rewards for everyone else.\nRethinking Evaluation\nAn increasing number of organizations have been listening to their employees’ complaints and taking a more sophisticated approach to performance management. They are replacing year-end appraisals and ratings with in-depth conversations, often drawing on the myriad data points now available about employee and company performance, such as sales information, organizational climate survey results, and employee engagement data. A few firms have begun to experimentally shift away from the conventional PM approach. The companies that have joined this trend, either in pilots or full rollout, include Adobe, Cargill, ConAgra, Gap, Intel, Juniper Networks, Medtronic, and Sears. One noteworthy example is Microsoft, which revamped its entire approach in 2013. It now focuses evaluation on results that people deliver together, leveraging and contributing to one another, emphasizing continual learning and growth. The company completely retired traditional PM tactics, including ratings, distributions, and annual reviews.\nOnly one person feels neurologically rewarded by the PM exercise: the senior executive who oversees it.\nHow do these organizations transform their destructive performance ranking practices into a system that can develop talent consistently and pay people fairly? They do it by not throwing out the old approach entirely. In the CEB study, goal setting was shown to increase performance by 36 percent. Even feedback, which is often destructive to learning, can be designed in a productive way (see “The Problem with Feedback” ). The structure of bonuses and the calculation of salary can also be improved.\nAs firms make the courageous transition to a no-rating system, they tend to choose one of two options. The first is highly structured types of conversations regarding employee performance. The HR department might lay out five or six topics to discuss in an annual review, such as career growth, contribution, collaboration, or innovation. The companies also provide guidance on how to talk about each topic.\nThe second option is a guided conversation. Instead of topics, the company provides a general framework (and often some training for managers). The conversation focuses on the goals people set for themselves and how they are progressing toward those goals, along with their contribution, past and present, to the company.\nIn either a structured or a guided conversation, one key element is to prime people—both the employee and the boss—to induce a growth mind-set. This improves how people listen to feedback, encourages them to set stretch goals, makes it easier for them to put in extra effort toward a worthy project, and helps them learn from positive role models.\nYou can hear the difference between the fixed mind-set and the growth mind-set in the subtle nuances of conversation, and managers can make a difference in a company by deliberately choosing one kind of phrasing over another. For example, in giving feedback to employees, the phrase “You did well; you must be talented” activates a fixed mind-set. Talent is perceived to be innate and changeless. If the manager says instead, “You did well; you must have worked hard on this” or “I see you put everything you had into this,” a growth mind-set is activated in the employee. The effort and creativity that people bring to bear makes a difference.\nThe employee can also prime the boss. For example, saying “I want to be the top performer” primes the fixed mind-set. It implies there can be only one. By contrast, saying “I want to take on challenges where I can learn new things” primes the growth mind-set.\nIt’s worth the trouble to prime people for the growth mind-set. In one study, priming a group of managers that way consistently made them more confident in their abilities and more likely to follow the example of a positive role model. That could be because the growth mind-set allows people to follow others with no perceived loss in status. Conversely, the fixed mind-set automatically implies a zero-sum competition: If someone rises in status, everyone else must fall. People holding that mind-set are more likely to attack one another’s success instead of focusing on their own development.\nAnother intriguing trend in productive performance review conversations surprised us at first. Some firms that got rid of most numerical ratings have left one type of rating in place: the determination of whether someone is essentially “in or out” as a fit with the company’s culture. At Juniper, this is defined as being a “J-Player” or a “Non-J Player.” A J-Player is someone who generally behaves according to Juniper’s values and delivers reasonably good performance. Juniper clearly and consistently explains which types of behavior result in Non-J Player status and helps those employees fit in if they choose to stay. More than 80 percent of the people rated as Non-J Players have opted to leave the company; they understood why they would never succeed there.\nThe success of this “in or out” rating system seemed disturbing until we recognized why it was necessary. Executives were reluctant to remove rankings, but not for the reasons we thought they would be. They didn’t care much about identifying problem performers. The new system addressed that issue. They wanted to weed out people who did not fit with their culture, and who were thus holding back their departments and colleagues. We also saw another virtue: This simple system decoupled the question “Should you stay here?” from the question “How can you grow here?” This meant that among those designated as J-Players, the conversation could focus on the individual’s professional and personal growth, without the anxiety of wondering whether he or she would be ranked poorly.\nA third trend we are seeing is the effort, at many companies, to reframe the entire PM process as something else. “An engineer in our Bangalore Excellence Center,” says Steven Rice of Juniper, “pointed out that our performance management process was a violation of our values, because the forced ratings didn’t enable leaders to authentically provide feedback or truly trust their judgment to administer rewards.” That led Rice to realize that they could not fix the system piecemeal; Juniper had to imagine a whole new kind of practice, one that “delivers the benefits without the unintended negative consequences.”\nSince 2011, Juniper has not given ratings to employees or kept documents of ratings. It also eliminated forced rankings. The new method focuses heavily on regular quality conversations between managers and employees, using the structured conversation model. Overall, Juniper has seen participation and satisfaction skyrocket among employees and managers. On the semiannual day of evaluation (known as “Conversation Day”), more than 88 percent of the participants reported that their conversations were “helpful” or “very helpful.” “We have increased differentiation and alignment of rewards against relative contribution,” Rice says. “Eighty-seven percent of the employees reported that they were willing to give extra discretionary effort, and 79 percent believe they can do their best work at Juniper.”\nAt Gap, managers conduct monthly conversations in a new performance management process called “Grow, Perform, Succeed.” (Its abbreviation, GPS, is also the company’s stock symbol.) By redesigning its PM system and giving it a new name, the company repositioned the process as less of a threat. That in itself is an important step to better conversations.\nSharon Arad, a Cargill executive, describes how the company made this kind of shift after reviewing its PM system a few years ago: “We found the system failed to generate quality conversations, leaving employees with a [ranking] that many viewed as a deficiency statement. In the end, the ratings given were not a trustworthy indicator of the actual status of performance or engagement.”\nMany Cargill leaders wondered whether removing the ratings would bring about more desirable results and better conversations. So they set up a no-rating pilot of several thousand employees for three years. Every year Arad’s team compared the pilot group’s feedback to that of a random sample of rated employees. “Overall, 90 percent of the no-rating pilot participants reported, year after year, that their experience was positive,” Arad says. This was in stark contrast to the feedback that people normally gave about their performance management experience. Finally, this year, Cargill adopted the no-rating approach for its entire organization.\nThe results of no-rating systems are dramatically better than their rating and ranking counterparts—in satisfaction, retention, and engagement scores, which have been shown to correlate to organizational performance. We believe the number of companies operating this way will increase dramatically, to become the majority. It would be nice to think that eventually the ideal of labeling people numerically will be seen as a blip in the history of HR. Giving people a rating might be a useful tool in a company with a lot of “fat,” where it makes sense to shake people up and create competition, but in many of today’s lean businesses that demand a great deal from their employees, we need a better model. We need to improve the quality of the conversations we hold with workers. It’s time to kill your performance ratings.\nThe Problem with Feedback\nHuman resources professionals have long assumed that most employees appreciate feedback: direct commentary about their performance. It is taken for granted that feedback motivates everyone to perform, and that top performers find it particularly useful. None of this is true. Although those with a growth mind-set react more positively to it than everyone else, typical feedback is not motivating, rewarding, or pleasant. According to one study, everyone hates it.\nPsychologists at Kansas State, Eastern Kentucky, and Texas A&M universities asked 234 staffers at a large university how they felt about performance reviews they had received. The respondents were split up into three subgroups: those who said they were considered competent, those who avoided difficult tasks (to avoid negative feedback), and those who focused on developing and learning skills. The researchers expected that the individuals motivated to learn and develop skills were most likely to take negative feedback in stride. But it turned out that all three groups found negative feedback demoralizing, and all to the same extent.\nManagers who conduct performance reviews typically do not take into account the way people feel about feedback. Even innocuous remarks that carry praise can easily be misconstrued as criticism. There’s a biological reason for this. Until they’re about 12 years old, human beings obtain most of the resources for survival from other people. As a result, humans have well-developed neural circuits for reading the social environment. Having this type of brain makes us highly attuned to social threats and rewards.\nMost feedback primes people with a fixed mind-set—for example, cuing them with statements like “This is how you are.” That in itself makes people less open-minded. In another study, Jennifer Mangels, now director of the Baruch College Dynamic Learning Lab, and her colleagues monitored brain activity in two groups of people while the participants were asked some common-knowledge questions about history, literature, geography, and other academic topics. The first group were people with a fixed mind-set; they had said that they believed intelligence could not change. The second group, with a growth mind-set, had said they believed it could. In each case, after the questions, the groups received feedback—commentary about their performance on the quiz—and then they were given the correct answers.\nCompared to the growth mind-set group, those with a fixed mind-set had more activity in a frontal part of the brain that is associated with responses to negative sensations. When they received the correct answers, they also had a shorter duration of the brain activity associated with long-term learning. Their attention was more likely to move elsewhere—perhaps to reacting to the feedback. When they were given a retest a short while later, the fixed mind-set group also showed less performance improvement, even though they started out the study performing equally well.\nIn short, there is reason to think that most performance-related feedback from other people, even when well intentioned, diminishes employees’ ability to learn. To compensate, it must be carefully designed to foster a growth mind-set.\nReprint No. 00275\nAuthor profiles:\n- David Rock is cofounder and director of the NeuroLeadership Institute, a global initiative bringing neuroscientists and leadership experts together.

    "age": "899 days ago",
    "content": "Run a Team Meeting with KPIs\nGeneral company updates or things they need to know are great to share with employees before the meeting. Then allocate a few minutes for any questions from the team about those topics. If your team meeting involves multiple departments, this is a great way to get information from them ahead of time instead of spending the first 20 minutes of your meeting getting updates from everyone. Everyone should have audio and video when working from home to get more team collaboration.\nRun a Team Meeting Where Making Decisions Makes Meetings Effective\nIt is hard for employees to know their roles in a meeting when it comes to decisions. Are they there to listen? Are they to provide input? Do you want to make this decision by consensus? Be sure to make clear in these scenarios who is ultimately responsible for making the decision and ensuring you have the team's support for the decisions being made and implemented. The purpose of a staff meeting is to solve problems, not create more of them, so solve everything you can while you are together as a team. Ensure that all action items are recorded and assigned to the proper employee.\nRun a Team Meeting with an Agenda\nIf you have a big project to discuss, don't leave it for the last five minutes of your meeting. If a conversation goes on too long, see what can be redirected to the next session or set a time to follow up on that topic after the team meeting. The weekly meeting facilitator will have to make some judgment calls in real-time as to whether it is worth continuing the discussion, getting it back on track, or tabling it. Individual team members should have the chance to participate in each agenda item that is relevant to them. The person taking the meeting minutes is often the best person to nudge the meeting back on track.\nPrepare for the Team Meeting\nA successful team meeting will have a leader who can facilitate the conversation, but that leader doesn't have to run the entire session. Once you've determined your agenda topics and meeting schedule, could you let your team know if they need to prepare to share information in advance? This is a fantastic opportunity to give team members a chance to lead discussions, share important updates, offer suggestions, and come away with action items for the next meeting. Still, they can only do that if they're prepared. Only spring a topic on them at the forum if you want a productive discussion. Feel free to bring any additional insight from your skip-level meeting questions.\nGet Better at Each Weekly Team Meeting.\nSeek feedback from your team on your meeting agenda. What worked well and what didn't? You can use that information to tweak your agenda to what works best for the team and their needs. This continuous feedback loop will ensure that your weekly team meetings get better each week. In work-from-home and remote teams, you should avoid conference calls when possible and use web conferencing software like Microsoft Teams or Zoom. Make sure that you start the meeting on time, clearly explain the purpose of the meeting, and get better each week. Pretty soon your bad meetings, turn into tolerable ones and eventually great meetings.\nA team meeting should be something the employees look forward to each week — a place where they can share their concerns, share ideas, ask questions, get valuable information, and feel that they are part of the overall process. 80% of your weekly meetings should be spent solving problems. Here is how to fix weekly meetings. Take some time to craft your agenda to make the most of that weekly team meeting slot and treat it as a weekly team-building exercise rather than something you just have to survive!\nIf you want to run the perfect executive team meeting, read this post, our check our learn section to learn more about the multiple types of meetings.\nNeed help getting your team aligned to achieve your growth goals?

    "title": "Unlocking the Multiplier Effect of Modern Performance Management: How to Boost Employee Experience Metrics",
    "domain": "betterworks.com",
    "age": "898 days ago",
    "content": "In a competitive business landscape, organizations are keen on employee experience metrics like engagement, productivity, and retention. They serve as signals of whether a company is maximizing business outcomes with its workforce. But, according to the Betterworks 2023 State of Performance Enablement report, the key to delivering on these metrics requires fostering underlying sentiments such as trust, belonging, inclusion, fairness, and confidence that are the foundation for elevating employee experience. While there is no magic elixir that can create this utopia, research shows that having the right approach to performance management has a multiplier effect on organizations, yielding the higher engagement, productivity, and retention they value by improving how employees experience work day in and day out.\nThe Multiplier Effect of Performance Management shows the link between employee experience sentiments and the impact of performance enablement on them. Using data drawn from the Betterworks 2023 survey, this latest research underscores how the focus of modern performance management — meaningful manager-employee conversations, manager and employee feedback, agile performance and goal-setting, and recognition in the flow of work — influences and connects the dots between employee sentiments such as trust, fairness, satisfaction, inclusion, confidence, optimism, and resilience. These elements don’t just play a superficial role; they lie at the core of the employee experience.\nEmployee Experience Metrics — More Important Than Ever\nConsider just three aspects — albeit significant ones — of employee experience: trust, fairness, and belonging.\nAccording to Gallup, only 21% of U.S. employees strongly agree that they trust leadership in their organization, even lower than what Betterworks found in this year’s research (32% trust leadership). Without trust, it is impossible to achieve strong performance. Employees expect transparency and clear communications from leadership, including their managers, and need clarity about what leaders expect of them. Betterworks’ research shows that when employees are satisfied with their performance and career conversations with their managers, and when they feel their company’s performance management is a success, they have high levels of trust and confidence.\nFairness is closely associated with trust. Perceptions of fairness are affected by a multitude of factors, including DEI, pay and compensation structures, hybrid and in-office work policies, and performance management, to name just a few. When Gartner interviewed 3,500 employees worldwide in 2021, only 18% indicated they worked in a “high-fairness” environment. Betterworks 2023 survey showed that trust actually plummeted among employees who felt performance management practices were unfair (and skyrocketed by 2x-4x when they felt performance management was fair). Gartner found that what moved the needle on perceptions of unfairness were experiences that happen in daily work. Performance enablement is an approach that guides daily interactions and activities.\nA sense of belonging is a key sentiment that affects how employees feel about themselves and their colleagues — and has a tremendous bottom-line impact. Research by BetterUp found that a feeling of high belonging led to a 56% increase in job performance, a 50% drop in turnover risk, and a 75% percent reduction in sick days. For a 10,000-person company, BetterUp calculated an annual savings of more than $52 million.\nBetterworks found that fewer than 2 in 5 employees always feel a sense of belonging and value at work, but that satisfaction with manager conversations around performance boosts employees’ feeling of belonging. Nearly two-thirds of employees who felt valued at work reported they were always satisfied with their manager conversations around performance. That percentage dropped to 55% among employees who were sometimes satisfied with manager conversations and 47% among employees who were rarely satisfied with such dicussions.\nPerformance enablement: the heart of enhanced employee experiences\nPerformance enablement, an innovative and human-centric approach to performance management places these and other employee sentiments front and center and is a big lever organizations can push to improve and even transform company culture. When implemented correctly, performance enablement can be a game-changer for enterprises, resulting in a multiplier effect that extends far beyond typical key performance indicators.\nTraditional performance management relies on backward-looking assessments in the form of annual or semi-annual reviews, and structured feedback cycles. This approach fails to help employees “in the moment” and continuously, two aspects that can vastly improve employee effectiveness.\nEmployees often see performance management as a command-and-control exercise rather than one that helps them improve, which should be the intent. It also opens managers and employees to recency bias when it comes to reviewing an employee’s body of work. Unconscious bias may also creep into performance reviews if regular peer feedback is not incorporated, leading to lowered trust.\nPerformance enablement shifts the paradigm. It aims to strengthen the emotional and intellectual connection employees have with their work, acting as a launchpad for driving better performance and optimizing employee effectiveness. Instead of focusing solely on results, this approach dives deeper, helping employees connect with their colleagues and work emotionally and intellectually.\nBy understanding and reinforcing positive sentiments, organizations can redefine how employees perceive their roles, the purpose behind their roles, and their place within the organizational structure. This deeper connection with work, combined with a solid sense of belonging and purpose, serves as a powerful springboard for driving performance metrics.\nWhy evolve performance management systems?\nIt’s evident that businesses are catching on to the need for a revamped performance management strategy. Betterworks research shows that post-2020, 46% of employees have seen their companies roll out new performance management systems. Yet, intention doesn’t always translate to success.\nA staggering 37% of employees in the Betterworks study graded their performance management systems as falling short. This isn’t a reflection of resistance to change but rather an indicator that the change introduced might not be in the right direction. The challenge isn’t just to introduce new systems but to ensure they resonate with what employees truly value and desire.\nThe right kind of performance management matters. Sticking with an inadequate approach can be costly — even greater than the cost of implementing a new solution. A performance management system that undermines trust, fairness, and other key workplace sentiments can lead to lower productivity, higher employee turnover, and contribute to a poor culture that is reflected in lower eNPS and employer brand.\nDedicated performance management systems that promote rich relationships and purposeful conversations and feedback in the flow of work, and place emphasis on action, achievement, and accountability are better received and adopted by employees. Why? Because they provide real value and benefit. Higher adoption, in turn, enables enterprises to collect and analyze rich contextual data that drives better decision-making and organizational outcomes.\nCharacteristics of exceptional performance enablement\nCompanies must embrace a more holistic performance enablement mindset that starts not with productivity and engagement, but with the factors that contribute to those outcomes. In Betterworks’ 12 Qualities that Make Performance Enablement Exceptional checklist, we detail the qualities that organizations should use as a barometer for evaluating their approach and technology and the supporting data. In brief, they are:\n- Incorporates many voices: Prioritizes inclusion by involving various perspectives and feedback in performance evaluations.\n- Empowers managers: Equips managers with tools and guidelines to foster trust and transparency within their teams.\n- Aligns personal and organizational goals: Helps employees see how their individual tasks contribute to broader company objectives.\n- Helps employees with career goal-setting: Facilitates conversations about personal career growth and skill development.\n- Utilizes AI, including generative AI: Incorporates AI to simplify tasks like goal-setting and to offer unbiased feedback.\n- Drives ROI with people analytics: Uses data analytics to inform decisions on performance management, DEIB, and other areas.\n- Bridges the trust gap: Addresses the disparity in trust levels between employees, managers, and leadership.\n- Ensures fairness: Aims for a fair and unbiased performance evaluation process and calibration process.\n- Promotes appreciation and respect: Includes ways for managers and peers to recognize and appreciate good work.\n- Offers a user-friendly interface: Prioritizes an intuitive, easy-to-navigate user experience to encourage adoption and deliver rich data.\n- Integrates into daily workflows: Is designed to fit seamlessly into daily tasks in the flow of work and is scalable to accommodate future growth.\n- Centers on being forward-looking and participatory: Focuses on continuous improvement and frequent feedback, and allows for customization to meet organizational needs.\nAdopting a performance enablement mindset and establishing performance enablement that embraces these twelve qualities can significantly enhance an organization’s overall performance and deliver an employee experience that will drive engagement, productivity, and retention.\nThe Multiplier Effect of Performance Enablement",

    "content": "Story Highlights\n- Hybrid strategies should adapt to meet business and employee needs\n- Hybrid work improves work-life balance, efficiency and autonomy\n- The office is still the best place for employees to work collaboratively\nThe Situation:\nEmployees are returning to the office in droves, and hybrid work arrangements are quickly becoming the new normal for many remote-capable employees.\nEmployers are scrambling to determine how to make hybrid work as engaging and productive as possible.\nCrafting an effective hybrid strategy, work environment and culture begins with leaning into what's working, adjusting what's not working and adapting as lessons are learned.\nKey Questions:\nUsing a nationally representative sample of 8,090 remote-capable employees, we studied how hybrid workers -- who spend part of their week in-office and part working remotely -- are experiencing their new work environment after returning to the office from pandemic restrictions.\nIn our quest to better understand what is working and what needs to be improved in these hybrid work environments, we examined two key questions:\n- What are the advantages and challenges of hybrid work?\n- How are hybrid workers spending their time on-site versus at home?\nThe Findings:\nInsight No. 1:\nWhat are the advantages and challenges of hybrid work?\nThe greatest advantages of hybrid work to date are: improved work-life balance, more efficient use of time, control over work hours and work location, burnout mitigation, and higher productivity.\n- Hybrid work provides the flexibility for employees to work in ways that are most effective for them.\n- Employees believe their current hybrid arrangements improve their personal wellbeing and productivity at work.\n- Hybrid individual contributors, managers and senior leaders closely agree on both the top advantages and disadvantages of hybrid work -- signifying more common ground in organizations than might be expected.\nThe greatest challenges of hybrid work include: having the right tools to be effective at work, feeling less connected to the organization's culture, impaired collaboration and relationships, and disrupted work processes.\n- Hybrid work is creating a need for better coordination of resources, both at home and on-site. Home offices now need to be fully functional, permanent workstations that maximize personal productivity. On-site offices and conference rooms need to be remote-capable collaboration stations so remote participants are fully included in team interactions.\n- While organizational culture is substantially more difficult to cultivate in a fully remote environment, hybrid work still presents its challenges as people working remotely intermittently throughout the week will feel disconnected at times.\n- Similarly, teamwork and relationships will be challenged in new ways. Hybrid work creates the opportunity to spend meaningful time together in the office collaborating and building relationships. However, hybrid work also requires more extensive coordination of meetings and schedules, from determining when others are available and in the office to figuring out how to lead hybrid meetings with part of the audience online.\n- Notably, the top challenges of hybrid work are far less prevalent than the top advantages. This indicates that the greatest advantages of hybrid work substantially outweigh the biggest challenges.\nInsight No. 2:\nHow are hybrid workers spending their time on-site versus at home?\nWhen working on-site, employees prioritize: collaborating with colleagues, connecting with their manager and using technology that is unique to that location.\n- Hybrid workers are spending their time on-site addressing the aforementioned top challenges of being away from the office part of the week -- deep collaboration, resource utilization and relationship-building.\n- It's important that managers help employees be very intentional about making good use of their time on-site. They should be encouraged to spend time with teammates, network with colleagues from different teams and use the equipment best leveraged on-site.\n- In contrast, forcing everyone into the office just to take Zoom calls and do independent work tasks they were doing from their living room in pajama pants will not be a welcome use of time for most hybrid workers.\nWhen working from home, hybrid workers are primarily focused on: head-down, independent work tasks -- away from the distractions of the office.\n- Time at home helps hybrid workers efficiently drive personal performance while allowing for the flexibility to meet other life responsibilities, such as running errands or taking children to school and activities.\n- This time to focus on personal work tasks and responsibilities may become even more important as employees spend more of their time on teamwork and relationship-building when on-site.\n- As a cautionary insight, hybrid employees are not spending much WFH time with their manager, so feedback, recognition and development may primarily be isolated to in-person interactions. These important employee needs are low on the list of hybrid work advantages -- but also are not flagged as major challenges, suggesting they may be falling off the radar for some employees and managers.\nWhat Leaders Should Do Next:\nThe art of hybrid work largely comes down to leveraging the advantages it creates, quickly addressing its challenges and being very intentional about how time is spent on-site versus at home.\nStart by asking your team members what's working, what's not, and what's most effective for them -- and then track how those answers change with time and repetition. Ask questions like:\n- Describe the work you do that can be done independently.\n- Describe the work you do that is better when we work together.\n- What happens when we are in person together that doesn't when we work from home?\n- Describe the times when our team works best with other teams.\n- Describe the times when you feel connected to our team's culture.\n- How do we build some predictability in our work schedules so in-person time is maximized?\n- Describe the times when we have created exceptional value for our customers.\nTo build a hybrid work strategy:\n- Learn more about what makes a solid hybrid work strategy for employees and organizations.\n- Contact Gallup to discuss building a culture where hybrid work succeeds.",

He also explains how you can balance your team members’ unique strengths and interests with your business goals. This episode originally aired on HBR IdeaCast in April 2022, as part of a special four-part series called Find Joy in Any Job. Here it is.\nALISON BEARD: I’m Alison Beard. This is the HBR IdeaCast, and we’re looking at how to find joy in our work.\nAt a time when lots of people are feeling burnt out, disengaged, and unhappy in their professional lives, we’re explaining with the help of author, Marcus Buckingham, how to change our jobs for the better. We’ve already talked about how to figure out what makes you happy and shift your job so you spend more time doing those things. Today, it’s about the team and organization, how to get everyone doing more of the work they love.\nSPEAKER 1: What I’ve discovered over time is that my strengths are somebody else’s weaknesses, and my weaknesses are somebody else’s strengths. So, I really rely on my staff and my interns and my attorney and my accountant to help me in the areas that are not my core competencies, so that they have not only a chance to shine, but also do good work for me. And because they are subject matter area experts in these areas, it takes them less time to do.\nSPEAKER 2: I really love the people that I work with, the team is incredible, passion-driven and really wants to make a difference and be accountable to their work. And as president, I manage that team. So, I am working directly with a variety of different team members, trying to make sure that they’re happy and fulfilled in all of the work that they do.\nALISON BEARD: Marcus’s book is called Love and Work. And Marcus, I’m so happy to have you back.\nMARCUS BUCKINGHAM: I’m so happy to be back.\nALISON BEARD: We’ve talked a lot so far about what we can do on an individual level, managing our self, and what this process should look like. The next step obviously would be to try to scale that up to the team level. You can do it as we discussed before, by helping other people find their red threads, which are those things that really bring them joy, get them into flow. But then how does the sort of higher level person – the boss, the team manager – make sure that every direct report is moving in this more positive direction?\nMARCUS BUCKINGHAM: Well, it begins with something, what we’re talking about here is teaming. It is interesting. You’re on the phone with CEOs all the time, as you can imagine, because people are asking about, well, what about culture? And should we bring everyone back to work? Because what about the damage to culture if we don’t? And when you really peel the onion on what the heck are you talking about, vis-a-vis culture? They’re really talking about two things. One is talent brand, which we can get to later, but the other one is teaming. Like, how do we get people to work collaboratively with one another, quickly, when they don’t know each other, some of them will never meet each other, and yet we do a lot of our work together? So how do we do that? How do we team? One of the things that we’ve got to be able to do better than we currently do it is to team joining. It should be a discipline. If you’re a team leader and you’re listening to this, get good at team joining. What team joining is, it’s like onboarding on steroids. Onboarding is, hey, new team member. Here’s your password, here’s your computer, here’s how you get onto such and such. It’s administrative. Team joining is who the heck are you? We’re going to get together as a team. And if you could, we’d like you to share. And again, you don’t have to use the language of red threads. That might not be language that fits you. But what you want that person to share is what do you love to do the most? When are you at your best? What can the team super rely on you for? Give us some detail. And then please tell us where you’re a bit of a deer in the headlights. Tell us where you struggle, tell us where you might need help from someone. Let’s just start people off knowing that on the best teams, we don’t have a whole bunch of perfect people. We’ve got people that need one another. That’s what a team is. So, team joining, building a discipline around when you join a team, we do actually need you to share some of your red threads and some of the other colors. And hey, I’m your team leader. I don’t expect you to have all red threads, because then I don’t trust you. And you know what? The team doesn’t either. It’s like when you say to a waiter, “What’s good here?” And the waiter goes, “Everything.” And you now don’t trust the waiter. And so, for you as a team leader, if you are one, start off with that. Bring the new team member on and then figure out the way that works for you and your team for them to say, hey, listen, this is when I’m at my best. And then over here, this is where I might need some help. Like that’s just so great. Now initially they might be a bit scared because they’ve never really done that before. So it might be good for you to have a session together, like a team blend session, where in order to make that new person feel comfortable, you go around the room and each person does that. This is where I’m at my best and this is where I might need some help. By the way, that’s kind of fascinating.\nALISON BEARD: Yeah. Because it’s not just for someone who’s joining an organization or joining a team. It’s for when project teams are coming together. That’s sort of the future of work. It’s the present of work actually.\nMARCUS BUCKINGHAM: Absolutely.\nALISON BEARD: And so, anytime you’re getting together with colleagues who you might know, might not know that well, that seems like a useful exercise.\nMARCUS BUCKINGHAM: Yeah. And look, when I was at Gallup, me and Don Clifton made something called Strength Finder, 25 million people had taken Strength Finder. That’s sort of useful. If you’ve taken Myers-Briggs, that can be sort of useful. I made another assessment 10 years later called StandOut. That can be useful, to say, give people a short hand for how you think or what drives you. All of those are kind of cool actually. I would though suggest that that love note idea. Just write three of them. I love it when, and then finish the sentence. Sometimes we, as team leaders, I know I’m guilty of this too. You’re running so quickly, you bump into people pre-pandemic in the hallway, you’ve got some client you’re trying to satisfy or some project deadline you’re trying to meet. And you sort of think that by osmosis you’re going to pick up on that person. But it is like a massive eye opener to actually spend an hour. Let’s go, guys over lunch, let’s sit down. Let’s just all of us share three love notes, and we’ll share them with each other because sometimes we make assumptions and we shouldn’t.\nALISON BEARD: Obviously you would explain what a love note is before suggesting that as a boss. For fear of running foul of harassment policies.\nMARCUS BUCKINGHAM: Yeah, I’m just using that. Yeah, you could figure out whatever word you want to use for that. It’s a statement. Who I am, what I love most, where I’m at my best. And the language there isn’t I’m the best at. I mean, some of this really gets into the language. Hey, team leader, don’t get your people to claim what they’re the best at. You don’t need that sort of comparison anyway. And that’s, by the way, one of the problems we have with our performance management systems, is we introduce all these comparisons, you’re a five, you’re a three, you’re a four. And as we’ve all discovered as parents, if we have kids, when you compare, you disappear. So don’t have people say, I’m the best at. Say I’m at my best when. Or I love it when. That’s what I mean by a love note. I mean, tell people what your red threads are. Maybe it’s a red thread note and you’re just taking the moment to go, let’s go around the room so that we can let each person be seen. Oh my word.\nALISON BEARD: Yeah. And you mentioned regular check ins in a previous episode, suggesting that individuals might want to ask their boss for that time and attention so that they can begin shifting their work towards more of the things that they love. From the boss’s perspective, that’s something you should set up with every team member. And from the organization’s perspective, it’s something that you should require of every manager.\nMARCUS BUCKINGHAM: Absolutely. It should be the way in which we understand what a leader actually does. It’s such a simple ritual. But I mean, Cisco does 3 million of these check ins a year. It’s not complicated, it’s not expensive. It’s just saying to every single team leader, you need to be to talking with each of your people individually about the near term future every week. There’s something super powerful Alison about a week. Every single human society ever studied has a seven day week, which is weird because there’s no cosmological equivalent to a week. There is for a day, there is for a month. The cycles of the moon. There is for a year, Earth around the Sun. There’s no cosmological equivalent for a seven day week. It’s just that every human society anywhere went seven days seems about right. There’s something about a week. And our memories are good for a week. Beyond a week, we suffer from the recency effect and we can’t remember what we’re doing. You are my manager, you can’t remember what I’m doing. So if you want to really help me, that check in is the core ritual. It’s 52 weeks of you and me with all the complexity we could ever need in my loves and my work, or my loathes and my work. And by the way team leader, that doesn’t mean that you’ve got to try to make everybody do only that which they love. Remember the Mayo Clinic research that says the 20% is a threshold. But if somebody’s sharing something they love and something they loathe, and you’re talking about this upcoming week, you don’t have to maneuver everything so that person gets 100% red threads that week. Sometimes awareness is all that’s required. Sometimes a person sharing something about last week, they loved and loathed. They don’t want you to do anything necessarily. They just want to be heard and seen. And the frequent rhythm of that, they’re not storing it up for a twice a year individual development plan conversation. That kind of simple frequent … It’s not you telling them either team leader, it’s them telling you. What do you love? What do you loath? What are you working on? How can I help?\nALISON BEARD: I have to tell you, I think a week is too much. I mean, I think every other week is a good cadence. I feel like, and maybe it’s just because I’m mid-career mid career, slightly past mid-career probably. I have a great relationship with my boss and there’s a lot of trust and a lot of autonomy. So I feel like a week would be way too much for me, every week. Is that okay?\nMARCUS BUCKINGHAM: Each person is individual. Yeah. Well, when you run the data, once every 11 days, actually. If you’re checking in once every 11 days, all the other outcomes that we correlate to, engagement, resilience, employee turnover, productivity, performance ratings. When you get less frequent than once every 11 days, everything starts sliding south. Maybe not with you, Alison because everyone is unique. And as a team leader, by the way, a good thing to do would be to check in with people to see whether or not a week works for them. All I can tell you is the data suggests really strongly, that frequency matters. And the frequency that seems to work best for us, once every 11 days is how the numbers shake out. But in terms of the rhythms of most of our work, once a week is what that turns into. I would just say with you, Alison, I know, and I know your boss, you just need to be really careful that you don’t end up going, now it’s once every three weeks. Now it’s once a month. How many CEOs have 15, 17 direct reports? Because they’re like, oh my people are so senior, they don’t need me. Well, if you’ve had anyone saying that, just go watch the documentary, The Last Dance where Phil Jackson isn’t saying, oh, I don’t need to talk to Michael Jordan. He doesn’t need me. That’s the exact opposite. He’s talking to Michael after every darn game. Because he knows that so goes Michael’s attention and creativity and innovation, so goes the whole darn team. So it’s one of the first questions I would ask, frankly, if I was joining a company and I want to figure out whether or not they take love seriously, the first question I would ask is how many direct reports does the CEO have? And if the number is north of 10, red flag.\nALISON BEARD: And so should that be the case for every manager. Should that org chart never have more than 10 people under another?\nMARCUS BUCKINGHAM: Well, in terms of this whole love and work idea, if you’re talking to people frequently about their loves and their work, their loves and their short term priorities and what they’re focused on, that is a mechanism for attention. And so when we talk about spanner control, we should be talking about span of attention. There may well be some managers who are such great individualizers, their span of attention could extend to 15 to 20 people. I will tell you that when you run the data on this at scale meta analytically, the chances that you’ll be in 90th percentile of engagement is inversely correlated to the size of the team. So, I’m not suggesting Alison that you don’t have some team leaders that are that good at keeping individuals feeling like they’re paid attention to with teams north of 15 or 20. I’m just saying it’s the exception that proves the rule. We should be thinking about org structure through the lens, frankly, of the check in, which is why the hospital example of one nurse supervisor to 60 nurses. It makes sense for the CFO. It just doesn’t make sense for the way that human beings work, which is why just last week I was talking to the CEO of a hospital, who’s got 13,000 people and 750 nurse openings and that’s not just the pandemic. If you get north of 10, then you better be a really good chess player in the sense that you, the team leader, better be able to keep that uniqueness. So all that wonderful unique set of loves, you better be super, super good at keeping all of that uniqueness in your mind, which a few people are.\nALISON BEARD: Isn’t it really hard to find enough people to love everything that needs doing on a team or in an organization? Those 750 openings, for example, this sort of seems like a herculean task for any boss or CEO to say I’m going to find all of these people. And every person here is going to have red threads, 20% red threads in their roles. That seems so hard.\nMARCUS BUCKINGHAM: Well, but not when you think about the sheer range of the human condition. How varied are we? We are extraordinarily varied. We’ve got these 5,000 Milky Ways in our brains and that’s not a bug. That’s not a design flaw. That’s actually what’s powerful about human beings is we’ve got this kind of range. So when we think about putting teams together. 50,000 years ago, we figured out that the team was the best mechanism or technology or context within which we make use of that kind of uniqueness. That’s the team, which is why frankly, another great question to ask if you’re considering joining a company is, what does this company do to understand what its best teams are like? Frankly many companies don’t see the team as the most important unit of analysis and discovery in a company. And yet they should because that’s what work actually really is.\nSo it lives and works on a team Alison and it does occur there everywhere where we see great teams, we see uniqueness and, yeah, we don’t see everybody having 100% red quilt. We don’t. But we do see intentionality around the fundamental design principle is each of my people loves different things. Each of them therefore learns and contributes differently. And I, as the team leader, I can’t pretend that’s not true. I can’t tell people their loves are a lie or irrelevant, which unfortunately in many organizations is exactly what we tell them. We certainly tell our students that in high school and college. But in the real world of business, you want to build a great team, your fundamental design principle has got to be curiosity about the unique loves of each person, because that’s what drives excellence. So if you want excellence, you’ve got to do it team by team.\nFor the CEO, yeah, maybe they’re sitting there all by themselves, five miles behind the front line and going, oh man, all these silly, darn, unique people. Although I’ll tell you this. About 20 years ago, I had the good fortune to spend some time with General Colin Powell and we were talking about human uniqueness and teams and this wasn’t about love. I wasn’t talking about that at the time, but we were actually just talking about individualization and he said, “You know what? That’s why the army has squads of 10.” People think the army is full of conformity. It isn’t. It’s full of squads. And the best squad leaders are incredibly curious about what the unique role is of each person on the team. One’s the sniper, one’s the explosive experts, one’s the communications. Person.\nAnd yes, they’re taught to do all the different roles because in combat people get killed or injured and they’ve got to do everything. “If you want to build good squad, you’ve got to figure out who’s wired which way. And then you build a squad around that.” It’s like, oh, okay. Well, if he can do it, then any CEO can do it. The problem in most companies is they just don’t.\nALISON BEARD: They’re not trying. But surely the bosses and the companies that do, are better able to attract talent?\nMARCUS BUCKINGHAM: Absolutely. And this is where the fundamental opportunity is for organizations. I think what we’re going to see moving forward. Any CEO trying to say, you must come back to the office as though they’re dealing with a work force that’s the same as it was pre-pandemic. It isn’t. The people, in all walks of life, every company, have had a really interesting last two years, and they have looked at themselves in the mirror and they have seen some scary things about themselves. And then they’ve sort of bounced back or up and they’ve figured out who they are independent of anything else, independent of any rituals, who they are, and what they value, which is by the way, we see more employee activism than we’ve ever seen before.\nSo the best CEOs will have to deal with the fact that we are changed. We are changed people and we’re coming back to work saying, I’ve actually found quite a lot about myself. And I want to go back to a workplace, which at least accommodates that as a design principle. It doesn’t have to be perfect. They probably won’t use this language, but no one’s really saying I want to do only that, which I love. Like most of us are realistic, but we want the design principle to be, we are super curious about you, and who you are, and how you’re wired, and how you can contribute it. We want that. So if companies want to deserve the best people, one of the most important things that they could do is have a talent brand that is explicit about that.\nWe’re curious about you. We want to know what’s inside you. And we want to know how that can be turned into contribution. We’re fascinated by that. Lululemon does a really good … Not to pick one company, but when you first join, they want to know all about your goals and aspirations and dreams. And if your dream is to become the CEO of Lulu, that’s so great. But if your dream is to in three years, leave and start a healthcare brand, or a yoga studio, that is equally celebrated. So right from the get go, they’re like what’s inside you? What are you into? That’s a really, right now, a very compelling talent brand. It’s not vague. It’s very specific. And I think it ties right into where people are right now.\nALISON BEARD: And the organizations that you’ve worked with to make this happen, whether complete or in progress – I guess it’s always in progress. What concrete results have you seen in terms of increases engagement, which I think research has clearly shown leads to better performance. But hit me with all of your results.\nMARCUS BUCKINGHAM: Well, what you’re seeing is some of the stuff inside of companies where you can see when you do something as simple as a check in about what a person loved and what they’re working on next week, just that simple, you get reductions in turnover in the following 3 months, 90 days, 67% reduction in turnover, even during this whole Great Resignation thing that we’ve sort of been going through in the last 18 months. 67% reduction in employee turnover, 77% increase in employee engagement. Simply by doing just a ritual, that’s just one manager seeing, not even acting on. Just listening to an employee go what’d you love, how are you using it? What do you love, how are you using it? How can I help? It’s just that simple. So you can see really dramatic changes and quite quickly Alison, that’s the other thing. We do this once-a-year employee survey stuff, and then we wonder why our survey moves one percentage point up or one percentage point down. You start looking at team by team, by team, by team, by team. And you find very, very fast movement deltas on some really important metrics like engagement, like resilience, like employee turnover. I would say this though, there isn’t any one company at the moment that I’ve looked at that I think has got all of this lined up perfectly. I do think we’re moving much more intelligently in this direction because the labor markets are so tight, but there’s undoubtedly more that we need to start. And then there’s a bunch of stuff we need to stop.\nALISON BEARD: And so what is your sort of vision of the future of work in which more bosses do this, more companies do this, and it becomes sort of the standard way of operating?\nMARCUS BUCKINGHAM: Well, if we’re going to move in this direction, the fundamental design principle needs to be that love fuels learning, fuels innovation, fuels expertise, fuels contribution. Loveless excellence is an oxymoron. So we need to build organizations where the point of finding out that which you love is so that you can contribute more intelligently. And then when you contribute that, that informs what you love. And that that’s really the mechanism of what works all about. It’s an advance, I think on Stiglitz’s stakeholder capitalism, where we go, there’s the employee and there’s the customer and there’s the investor and there’s the community. The next step is no, no, no. The people are the point. That’s where work is going. The people are the point. The people are not a cog in a machine. They are not a mechanism for getting work done. Their loves and how they contribute them is the way in which we do anything. And if we keep moving in that direction, the other constituencies will be served, but there isn’t four different constituencies, all equal. The most important constituency at work is the person, the people, the employee. We’re going to see more and more companies paying for lifelong education. Right now, you’ve seen the Walmarts, you’ve seen the Geicos, you’ve seen the Amazon, we’ll see more and of that. Yes, for pragmatic reasons, because they just want to be able to be competitive, but we are doing it, which is great because we’re looking at the person and going, their growth and development matters in and of itself. We’ll see more alumni programs Alison, where companies will go, we want to stay really to you even after you’ve left us. I mean, yes, because it might help us with our talent brand or it might help us with references with customers. But your worth doesn’t end when you stop working for us. And again, I point to Lulu here. You walk into a Lulu store, you see pictures of people all over the walls of people who’ve left. They’re now called ambassadors. It’s like that’s really smart because it shows every new employee coming in, we see you as a full and ongoing human, whether you work with us or not. So we’ll see a lot more super intelligent off-boarding programs, a lot more super intentional alumni programs. You will see more choice undoubtedly about where and when and how I work. Because frankly, we’ve learned a lot in this last two years about how to use that mastery and autonomy intelligently. So we are going to see more of that. You’ll see less emphasis on homogeneity and conformity. So less standard regulations, less standard competency models. You’ll see less 360 feedback tools to measure against said competency models. There’ll be less feedback which tells you which bits of the competency models you don’t have. All that’s … Less ratings because no one trusts ratings. You’ll have less cascaded goals because no one trusts goals and they’re blind to what you love. So quite a lot of the existing human capital management infrastructure, which is really well intended, flies completely in the face of the unique loves that each of us have. They’re loveless. So we’ll see all of that go away in those companies that want to attract people who are prepared to take their love seriously and turn it into contribution. We’ll see a lot of that infrastructure change. And in its place, I think we’re going to have organizations built around small, lightweight, agile teams where the team leader is trained upon, trained upon trained to be super curious about the unique loves and loathes of each person. Again, not for narcissistic reasons, but so that we can be more creative, more collaborative and more productive together. That’s what you’ll see.\nALISON BEARD: It sounds like a great vision. And so I hope that we get there. Marcus, thank you so much. We’ve learned a ton. I hope every listener has found a red thread, and is focusing more of their attention on it, and working to make sure that their teams, and their workplaces are places where everyone is finding more joy in their job.

    "domain": "rhythmsystems.com",
    "age": "901 days ago",
    "content": "“Time is an inelastic resource. No matter how high the demand, we cannot rent, hire, or buy more of it.”\n-Peter Drucker\nA Quick Note: This is a lengthy blog, but if you read it you’ll already be spending your time in an area where you should be spending your time (as you’ll see toward the end). So sit back, give yourself the gift of time, and enjoy the read.\nA primary focus of my job is to help middle-market CEOs and their Executive Officers increase their efficiency while also (and more importantly) increasing their effectiveness. Most CEOs I work with tend to agree that there’s never enough time in a day to do everything that needs to be done. As their companies grow and hit various ceilings of complexity, CEOs find that they, too, hit their ceilings of complexity. This realization is all-consuming and inundating, with the result being a string of behaviors that play out to result in focusing on what’s in front of them—on what they perceive deserves their time and attention at that moment in time (and many times, this intense focus also leads to long—very long—work hours). Interestingly, Harvard Business Review researchers found that the most effective leaders aren't the ones who constantly work a ton of hours each week, but rather the ones who are the most attentive and focused while at work. Most CEOs intend to be attentive and focused, yet the hunger to simply work long hours so they can do more can be a massive beast that slowly devours the most valuable resource CEOs have: Time.\nAs an Executive Coach, it’s my job to expedite the impact of executive officers by helping them discover how their time should be spent to maximize their time and increase their influence with the leadership team. With most of my coachees, it’s the Golden Question, “How should I be spending my time as a CEO?” The Golden Answer requires a shift in how CEOs think. Without a shift in thinking there will be little to no meaningful, higher-level shift in the executive’s daily routine.\nA Prerequisite for Knowing Where to Spend Your Time\nTradition breeds the way we think. Therefore, a prerequisite to knowing where to spend your time requires first challenging your assumptions about the role itself. For instance, it’s assumed by many that working long hours is simply a CEO's lot in life. It’s just what CEOs do (so you end up pushing yourself to work longer hours). Yet, there is a huge body of research that tells us that working longer hours does not equal higher levels of productivity. Longer hours also don’t equate to effectiveness, either. (Argue as you will, but the research is quite conclusive.) To be an effective CEO requires you to walk away from this and other false perceptions of what constitutes success for a CEO. The prerequisite, then, is for you to challenge your assumptions about what it means to be a CEO.\nParkinson's Law, first published in The Economist in 1955, states that \"work is elastic in its time.\" This means that if you set aside one hour to write a report, it'll take you the full hour. If you set aside 15 minutes, it will take 15 minutes.\nLook to stop working harder. Instead, think about how you can work differently. You’ll never be able to frame your time to the very minute because “life happens.” But you can gain a lot more control if you know what you should try to be attentive to and focused on as a rule. Just realize, too, that there’s a yin-yang to this whole endeavor of spending your time wisely in that it takes a ton of flexibility and discipline. As noted by Elena Botelhos, founder of the leadership research firm CEO Genome Project, “Often, when CEOs conduct calendar reviews and look at how their time is spent, they’re surprised to find that top priorities are regularly trumped by urgent fires.”\nSo be flexible, but also employ the discipline needed to be focused and attentive to what matters for you to be an effective leader of a growing company.\nHow Should CEOs Spend Their Time?\nHere are a few thoughts for your consideration as you strive to answer the question of how you should be spending your time. As I noted upfront, this is a longer read than a typical blog post, so simply sit back and allow the following points to stir your thinking.\nRemember:\n(a) How a CEO chooses to spend his/her time can depend on a multitude of variables, such as where the company is in its growth trajectory, the industry, how big an internal or external challenge is at the current moment in time, etc. The bottom line, though, is that there are core elements every CEO should work toward so that s/he can steer a growth company in the right direction. In other words, CEOs should focus on running their companies so that their companies don’t run them. They should use their executive assistants effectively to manage their time.\n(b) Secondly, remember that the percentages below are approximate. At certain times, you’ll spend more time on the strategic components (such as developing your 3 Year Strategic Plan and managing cash flow) or you’ll spend more time analyzing a gap and being a solution resource for a situation of primary importance, etc. The point is to strive for the approximations below to maximize your time for efficiency and effectiveness with your executive coaching engagement.\nCEOs Should Spend 40% of Their Work Time on the Future\nAs examples:\nLead to a Clarified Vision. Vision casting isn’t every CEO's favorite thing to do. With that said, though, challenge your assumptions about what spending time on the future means. It doesn’t mean you must be ‘good’ at visioning or dreaming about the blue business sky of tomorrow. It means that you must spend your time leading people toward the future. You can’t do this effectively without a good BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) and/or without a definition of where you want the company to be three to five years from now. Where you want to be (and perhaps what you want the company to be known for) defines where you spend your time today.\nSpend time creating opportunities by being ‘outward’ vs. ‘inward.’ An interesting analogy presents the CEO as the captain of the Titanic. The captain of the Titanic had talented and capable engineers in the engine room, great shows and entertainment onboard the ship, incredible chefs who delivered the best cuisine, and a wonderfully focused crew to take care of the ship’s guests. At the time, too, he had what was lauded as the most awesome ship in the world. With all these advantages, though, the captain still didn’t see the iceberg. So the ensuing question from this analogy is, “Should a CEO be looking inward or outward?”\nSpend your time keeping your company’s financial reservoir fueled by looking outward. By looking outward, you help focus your company’s future by being the creator of opportunities. In tandem, set the expectation for your executive team to teach their people how they’ll need to think about the future. For instance, salespeople may need to update their approach from a typical sales approach to more of a consultative one because your defined future may require them to become less transactional to engage more fully with core customer value. You can’t ignore internal operations but spend the bulk of your time on the external components that will fuel your company’s growth tank (i.e., building opportunities for the injection of new revenue) vs. spending time with an internal focus.\nThink of being ‘outward’ this way: Productivity serves to keep things moving internally (and it’s important), but productivity alone probably won’t make you #1 or #2 within a given market. Hire strong leaders to lead internal operations and maximize efficiencies and product/service delivery. You should only spend time internally if there are major issues (which might tell you that some adjustments around people and/or expectations need to be made). A key point here is that rarely are great companies built by the singular activity of sitting at a desk.\nCreate your future org chart. Draft it out. Don’t use names; just stick to titles that are recognizable to you such as CFO, EVP of Talent, CFO, Controller, etc. (You can change titles to something better later if desired; for now, though, just stick to titles that are a rote description of the positions.) As time passes, review your future chart. Revise it. Refine it. Work with it. Spend face-to-face time with the future leadership of your organization and learn their strengths and weaknesses.\nWhich areas are already filled with the right person? Which areas might someone grow into, and what might you do to encourage that person to grow so s/he is prepared for the new role when the company’s ready for it? Where is there a spot that’s currently filled, but the person just isn’t in the right seat? What might you do about that in the near term so that you’re better prepared to meet the future? Which spots don’t exist today but will need to be filled later? Prioritize those. Purposefully map the human side of your company’s future.\nNew CEOS will want to read our specialized article with 11 tips to get started as a new CEO.\nCEOs Should Spend 30% of Their Time on Strategy\nAs strategy execution examples:\nSpend time being strategic. With your executive team, jointly create three to five year goals (i.e., In three to five years, what do we want to be known for? What do we want to have accomplished by a point in time?). With this defined, be the rock on your team that gives time to set expectations around what the team will do this coming year as the first step toward your three to five year vision. What’s your Annual Plan? From this point, what’s your Quarterly Plan for the next quarter? Button everything up by identifying who’s accountable for what and by clearly defining what success looks like. Allow your leaders to take ownership.\nOnce your strategic roadmap is created, you can define where you should spend your time, internally and externally: Based on your strategic roadmap, should you spend time with key stakeholders? With essential supply chain partners? With your potential customer base? With current core customers who might grow their accounts with you? What is your CEO KPI dashboard telling you?\nCreate Accountability and a Culture of Transparency. Raise the bar on transparency while also raising the bar on personal accountability. This is probably the greatest advantage of a tool such as the Rhythm Dashboard. Each quarter is a 13-Week Race to accomplish a set of Quarterly Priorities that will take your company to where you want to be by year-end. Each week, your team members should each status the Quarterly Priorities they own so you can be more proactive than reactive by solving real-time problems, issues, and challenges during your Weekly Team Meetings. This type of transparency also builds a higher level of personal accountability throughout your organization. Work very hard to build accountable leaders and teams.\nUse your Weekly Meetings to streamline problem-solving. CEOs should gravitate toward concepts of ‘leadership’ vs. ‘management.’ Stop training the leaders that surround you to come to you to solve every single problem. You should steer these leaders to solve their own problems. Asking for your thoughts or expertise is fine, but this shouldn’t take hours and hours of your time, nor should you be pulled into every single meeting. As long as you let yourself be the #1 problem solver, people will come to you again and again to solve problems they should be effectively solving on their own.\nSimilarly, as long you think your presence is needed in almost every meeting, then progress will be stifled (because if you're unable to be present, no one will make any decisions because they’ll be waiting on you). Work to be a resource, but don’t work to be the one and only solution provider. If you have effective Weekly Meetings, then problems worthy of time should be discussed there. To borrow a concept from Apple, your executive team is your Genius Bar, so use the collective intelligence of your team as a resource to foster joint problem-solving on the issues that matter. Use your weekly team meetings as the platform for these discussions vs. one-on-one sit-down meetings that waste your time.\nCEOs Should Spend 15% of Their Time Analyzing Key Success Factors\nAs examples:\nPay attention to your company culture. You can measure the degree to which your company is highly performing (or not). So look to set the stage for a great culture and then measure your progress. Solidifying your culture means you’ll have less to worry about as you move toward spending more of your time outside your company. Your company culture can be a catalytic mechanism for you. I work with clients to measure the degree to which they have a high-performance culture (or not) by doing a general Culture Survey or by doing Leadership 360 Surveys on a group of key leaders. Doing this is essential because you’re given raw data. Your team of leaders can argue all day long about how people perceive your company culture to be, but no one can argue with the data. So put perception (and often wishful thinking) aside and measure your company’s culture. Only then can you be strategic about knowing what to do to build an even higher level of overall performance.\nYour culture is a catalytic mechanism simply because competitors have a very hard time copying a culture. They can copy a product, a service, a gizmo, or whatever. But there are plenty of business examples that demonstrate how very hard it is to copy a viable, high-performance company culture.\nUse the power of your presence. On a more personal note, also recognize that there’s a great deal of power in your presence as a CEO. Most CEOs I work with don’t ask for this but it’s a truth nonetheless. Your mere presence, your words, your actions, your smile, your demeanor—all of these serve to inspire those around you toward higher levels of performance…or not. Focus on nurturing the talent you have while building a strong productive culture. Paula Marshall Chapman, CEO of Bama, calendars in ‘walking the shop floor’ because she sees the strategic value of connecting with the people within her company.\nBottom line: When you’re in the office, work to get out of your office. Walk around; connect; talk; share; and smile. Be a resource for your leaders; be accessible. Hold your executive leaders to higher standards and accountabilities around these same endeavors.\nAnalyze any gaps (current or potential) that you see. Based on your company’s strategic intent, what’s working well, and why? What’s not working, and why? What’s a potential roadmap for filling the gaps? What resources (which includes your people) are needed to expedite a solution? Where does there seem to be a lack of clarity around expectations? What key internal functions need to operate at a higher level so that margins are increased? What results do you need to see that you aren’t seeing? At what revenue inflection points will we need to hire new people (and in what positions)?\nFocus on your people. Who is an underperformer that you need to have a talk with about expectations? Use this time to frame that conversation (and then have the conversation). Who needs your expertise, and how can you share that expertise? Part of this blends with “Creating your future org chart” from area #1 presented earlier in this blog.\nTake a Deep Dive. Another suggestion for using this 15% of your time is to take a deeper dive into understanding a core issue or challenge your company is having. By pausing to reflect and think, you give yourself the space to think more clearly. A new set of questions will emerge as you study and research a given area, as you allow yourself to ponder and entertain alternative ideas, and you’ll be extending your knowledge as well. If you don’t give yourself the time to pause and reflect, you’ll be forever caught up in the rat race. As the comedian Lily Tomlin once said, “The trouble with the rat race is that in the end, you’re still a rat.” So get out of the rat race and permit yourself to take the time and space to think…something…through.\nCEOs Should Spend 15% of Their Time on Strategic Leadership Mindset\n(i.e., self-reflection, self-edification, mindfulness, planning, and thinking)\nNOTE: If there’s time left from one of the above, it goes here.\nFor instance:\nStay smart. In short, read. Read blogs, read books, read articles. I had dinner with Daniel Pink a few years ago, and he noted that he purposefully reads magazines that are outside his given profession (such as Oprah) because he will read something that suddenly sparks his thinking about how to see a business challenge differently, or a tidbit will jolt his thinking on a key concept, etc. Warren Buffet believes that consistent reading is how knowledge builds upon itself, much like compound interest. Elon Musk is adamant about reading. Bill Gates, known for his firm belief that CEOs should have a regular rhythm for reading, affirms the notion of getting comfortable with whatever you’re reading: Write in the margins, draw arrows and stars, and turn down the corners of pages.\nAccording to Tom Corley, author of Change Your Habits, Change Your Life, 88% of financially successful people read at least 30 minutes a day. If you select a book, just chip away at it by reading ‘x’ number of pages a day. Don’t know which book to start with? Try Corley’s book noted above or The Wisdom of Crowds by James Surowiecki, or A Whole New Mind by Daniel Pink, or Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown, or Orbiting the Giant Hairball by Gordon MacKenzie, or Leaders Eat Last by Simon Sinek, or Rhythm: How to Achieve Breakthrough Execution and Accelerate Growth by Patrick Thean, or Predictable Results: How Successful Companies Tackle Growth Challenges and Win (co-authored by myself and my fellow consultants at Rhythm Systems). If you need more, just let me know…\nDon’t work on airplanes. Give yourself a break by not working on airplanes, treat it as \"you\" time, not work time. Instead, use the time to relax, read a magazine, thumb through a book, play video games, or watch a movie. In short: Chill! Phil Libin, the former CEO of Evernote, put it this way when interviewed by The Washington Post: “Like everyone else, I used to just work on airplanes—I'd use that as a time to catch up on things. And [then] I stopped. I said when I'm on a plane, I won't work. I'll read, I'll play video games, I'll sleep, I'll watch movies, but I don't work. It makes me look forward to flying. I can get off a long flight, and be kind of relaxed.\" If you're a mid-market CEO you probably don't take all of your vacation days, so use this time to relax and unwind. The average CEO works 9.7 hours per weekday and at least one weekend day.\nGet an Executive Coach. In a study by the International Coaching Federation, in consultation with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and the Association Resource Centre, Inc., the mean ROI of executive coaching was 7 times the initial investment, and over a quarter of coaching clients reported a stunning ROI of 10 to 49 times the cost. There’s a domino effect when you expedite your decision-making or when you improve your business sense and expertise as a leader. Learning how to lead differently catapults your ability to influence more productive behaviors of those around you.\nThe focus of Executive Coaching is on you as an individual in a business context. The emphasis is placed on increasing your effectiveness, thereby producing meaningful action. An Executive Coach will simply get you where you want to be quicker. A strong Executive Coach is good at truth-telling, (i.e., I remind my clients that as an Executive Coach, it’s my job to tell them what others might not want to tell them). As one CEO coachee recently said to me (after a bit of a pause), “You’re direct,” …another pause… “I really like that.” I smiled and said to him, “Glad you appreciate that because…it’s my job.”\nAn Executive Coach serves to help you gain clarity in your thinking, helps you wade through all the options you might have for dealing with a specific situation, serves to provide alternative perspectives around all the multiple components of growing a company, and helps you lead yourself toward your preferred future (so you’ll be spending your time as you should), jump-starts your thinking, and holds you accountable to your own Leadership Path of Progress.\nThe CEO Golden Formula, then, is “40-30-15-15”\nGetting to 40-30-15-15 takes a while; you can’t just flip a switch and be there. But you can start working toward maximizing your time so you aren’t working horrendous hours because you’re spending your time in worthless meetings or because you’re involved in too many internal operations. The company is more than just you and needs to operate that way. Start your journey today toward gaining control of your company while also reclaiming a bit of your focus of control (and sanity). Think about how you have spent your time over the previous 90 days. How close were you to the golden formula? How much more effective could you have been if you had used this CEO time management framework?\nSmart leaders don’t lead alone.

I am enthralled by smaller Olympic sports like bobsledding, water polo, swimming, archery, badminton, or the biathlon. For an athlete to simply get to the Olympics is an incredible achievement and testimony to years of competition, training, and sacrifice coupled with natural talent. There are no guarantees — work, talent, progress and rankings mean nothing until the championship moment, won or lost.\nLike an elite athlete getting a gold medal and having the pride of hearing their national anthem played, executives all want championship moments in their businesses. They seek to consistently deliver outstanding business results in terms of revenue growth, increasing profitability, and defensible differentiation from the competition — this is “winning”.\nNo one questions whether innovating, in all its flavors - product innovation, process innovation, business model innovation, is needed to achieve these championship moments. But do they realize that they actually have to go to the “sweaty gym” every day, build fitness and form and suffer defeat to become better, just to have the chance at glory? Do they realize that it takes years of having your “training system” in place to build for these championship moments?\nDo they have a long-term system for innovation, or is “hope” the real plan for innovation?\nA Set of Questions???\nTo evaluate how your organization has answered the critical question, here’s a diagnostic, a way to understand your answer to the one question. You could do this as a survey as input to a strategic conversation on innovation in your business:\nDo we have a deliberate, repeatable, measured approach for seeking and reviewing new ideas in the business?\nDo we only or primarily select “ideas” that we understand well and have high confidence in their success (low-risk concepts)?\nDo we have a one-size-fits-all approach for how projects are delivered?\nDo risky ideas ( or “bets”) employ an agile and MVP (minimally viable product) approach, seeking early customer participation and feedback?\nDo we have written processes, funding and dedicated leadership focused on innovation across different horizons?\nDo we have a portfolio management philosophy for our innovation investments?\nDoes the business have a balanced scorecard of metrics on innovation & growth including both innovation output metrics (such as % of revenue from products launched within the past two years or customer adoption of new business models) and innovation input metrics (such as the number of horizon 3 and horizon 2 ideas proceeding through experimentation)?\nDo the board and senior leadership have an agenda focused on innovation and include key metrics from a sustained innovation system?\nDiscuss these questions and you’ll know the honest answer to “do I have a system for innovation?”\nKey Elements of a System for Innovation\nThere are many “right” answers for the end-state system of innovation to which a business might aspire, as well as multiple paths to get there. The specific plan needs to be tailored to the current context of the business, the culture, and the ambition. But there is a set of three innovation elements that must be in place for innovation to become systematic.\nInnovation Element #1 — Think in Bets\nA “bet” is an idea believed to have impactful future potential to gain customers and deliver a financial return, but you can’t prove it. It’s a hypothesis for a new concept. There are many aspects or factors of the idea yet to be proven and if any of them should fail, the idea will likely fail also. For example, while the concept of the particular customer experience may sound great, we don’t understand what the unit costs might be or how to predict adoption. These types of ideas are “bets” and it’s important to recognize that these types of ideas are the critical input to the rest of your system for innovation.\n\"Think in Bets” infers that ideas need to be captured. Ideas need to be vetted. Decisions need to be made about which ideas are carried forward into the next key element.\nInnovation Element #2 — Experiment\nIn whatever form or methodology of “agile” development and minimally viable product approach you chose, the key is “speed” — speed in experimenting; speed to testing; speed to learning; speed in making decisions; speed on the next iteration. When it comes to innovation, the cost of delay should be considered the most important cost to manage, yet it’s regularly ignored.\nBut companies are typically good at one thing which negatively impacts the Experiment element — they slow ideas down. Companies slow down ideas because of the processes which must be followed, because of how resources are allocated, because of how other initiatives are planned, and in making it (experimentation) a true priority for executives. The real challenge here is finding deliberate approaches and strategies to counteract this natural orientation and to put in place catalysts for creating speed in experimentation.\nInnovation Element #3 — Build a Portfolio Strategy\nMuch like a VC firm, if the bets and associated incremental investments are small and fast, the job is to both manage the portfolio and to make the best decisions about each bet at the right time. The portfolio can be evaluated based on horizons (h1, h2, h3), risk & reward, adjacencies, problem types, and many other criteria. The key is to realize that there is a portfolio and that the portfolio needs to be aligned with other aspects of corporate strategy.\nFor larger organizations, the task at the corporate level becomes more like that of an endowment manager, overseeing a “portfolio of portfolios.” There may be multiple individuals in the organization accountable for managing the performance of their portfolios of bets, with room for an enterprise role in managing bets across portfolios. This approach enables more decentralized decision-making and avoids turning portfolio management into a decision-making bottleneck by funneling all bets through a small number of time-constrained decision-makers.\nBack to Your Key Decision\nHope is not a strategy. Luck is not a factor. Fear is not an option.\n— Director James Cameron.\nThe power of one committed decision should not be underestimated. Do we optimize for this quarter’s profitability, or for long-term growth? Are we willing to “fail” in our experiments, or do we only allow for only successful outcomes, in effect prioritizing only incremental improvements and safe ideas? Are ad-hoc approaches for evaluating and launching new products and business models going to satisfy our growth ambition?\nPLEASE SHARE WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES. Subscriptions are free (or you can pay with some additional subscription benefits)\nSo it really does come comes down to this one question —\nDo we create a system for innovation— or just HOPE that innovation happens?\nWhat’s your answer?\nOnward!\nJohn\nAbout The Digital Leader Newsletter\nJohn Rossman is an innovation coach and strategy advisor.

    "title": "How to Create the Freedom Every Founder Craves",
    "domain": "dave-bailey.com",
    "age": "909 days ago",
    "content": "How to Create the Freedom Every Founder Craves\nWritten by Dave Bailey\nMany founders feel trapped in their own ventures, searching for freedom. This strategy will help you regain control and find that entrepreneurial freedom you once dreamed of.\nWhen you ask most founders why they started their business, you’ll hear the answer they’ve been conditioned to provide: “I always wanted to solve this big problem”.\nHowever, there’s a more personal reason entrepreneurs build businesses that’s less acknowledged.\nMost founders start businesses to achieve freedom.\nBefore becoming an entrepreneur, I spent a few years as a management consultant with one of the top firms. I was better paid than all my friends—but it felt like a prison. I had no say in where I spent my time, who I worked with, and whom I served.\nI left consulting to found a business, dreaming of the day when I had complete control over my time. But as my business scaled, I started to feel trapped in the role I’d created for myself.\nSound familiar?\nIf you’re a founder who feels trapped by your business, you aren’t alone. I coach some of the world’s most elite founder CEOs who, behind the scenes, wrestle with this very situation.\nIndeed, I have found myself in this situation multiple times; attending meeting after meeting with a smile, while secretly feeling miserable.\nBut the key is to realise that this feeling is like one of Apple’s awful alarm sounds: it’s job isn’t to make you feel good, it’s to force you to wake up and get out of bed.\nThe great unshackling\nI’ve developed a method of helping founders to free themselves from the invisible forces that bind them to a life they hate—and evolve into better leaders in the process. It’s led to huge breakthroughs with all sorts of CEOs, and it can help you uncover deep insights about your life.\nThat said, you need to be an entrepreneur to experience its full benefit. Unlike entrepreneurs who trade security for freedom, employees trade their freedom for security, and therefore don’t have the leeway to implement this fully.\nStep 1: Clarify your short-term objectives (not the company’s)\nIt’s easy to confuse the company’s objectives with the CEO’s. However, the difference is critical. When you conflate the company’s objectives with your own, you’re likely to think every problem in the company is your project. You’ll jump in to fix your team’s problems—and your time will disappear.\nHere are some examples to illustrate the difference between company and CEO priorities:\n- Company objective: to achieve 3X growth\n- CEO objective: to set the company objective\n- Company objective: to launch a new capability by Q4\n- CEO objective: to hire a new product leader\nAn effective way to uncover your objectives is to go through each of the meetings you attend and ask yourself: “what difference am I trying to make by attending this meeting?”.\nWhile your objectives will be specific, they are likely to fit into one of these categories:\n- Set the strategy and communicate it to all stakeholders\n- Hire and retain a high-performing leadership team\n- Ensure the business has enough cash\nThe clearer your objectives are versus the company objectives, the easier you’ll find it to achieve them more efficiently.\nStep 2: If you could only work one day a week, how would you achieve these objectives?\nThis question forces clarity over what really moves the needle. The funny thing is most CEOs I ask this to quickly come up with a plausible answer:\n“Well, I’d work on Mondays. I’d run a team meeting in the morning, followed by separate meetings with my sales, product and finance teams. I’d have to reduce the duration or frequency of my one-on-ones as I’d have less time. And everything else I could delegate.”\nAchieving such a significant shift involves saying 'no' to a lot of other people’s priorities, including those of your team, investors, and other stakeholders. This can stir up a lot of emotions. However, there's a simple truth:\nIf you’re spending 80% of your time on other people’s priorities, you’re unlikely to make a dent in your own.\nOf course, you’re probably thinking… what should I spend the other four days doing? Well…\nStep 3: How do you want to be spending your time in five years?\nYou hear about the importance of long-term thinking in business, but the same holds true for individuals too. When you ask people how they want to spend time in the future, all the current problems and projects and minutia are instantly forgotten.\nSurprisingly, I frequently hear answers like this to this question:\n- I want to take a more strategic role in the business\n- I want to spend time networking to set up an acquisition or IPO\n- I want to build my personal brand\n- I want more free time—to spend with my family, my hobbies and travelling\n- I want to invest in early-stage businesses and support other founders\nNext, I ask them: “Will spending your time in this way make you a better leader?”\n“Of course!” they respond, before giving me a lengthy explanation about how much more present, clear-headed and positive they’d be.\nWell then… let’s not wait five years if you could be that leader in a few months!”\nThe ‘One-Day Transformation’\nWhat results from these thought experiments is a prototype of a new way of spending your time. You spend 20% of your time on what you currently do, and 80% of your time on a new set of activities that align with who you want to become.\nYour calendar could look something like this:\n- Monday: working or your current objectives, far more efficiently\n- Tuesday–Thursday: working on what you’d otherwise work on in five years\n- Friday: spending time out of the business\nWhy take a day out of the business?\nThis idea doesn’t tend to land with early-stage founders who are in the first few years of their business, actively involved in operating the business, and love their job.\nHowever, when you eventually crave freedom, remember this is a viable option.\nMany of the later-stage founder CEOs I coach reach a stage where they can take a full day out of the business per week. Not only does it provide a renewable source of clarity, serendipity and connection, it meets their primal need for freedom.\nWithout experiencing this freedom, they’d otherwise be miserable and resent the company they built.\nWorking on the foundations\nDistinguishing your objectives from the company’s and reflecting on your long-term goals will provide you with useful insights about how you want to spend your time. However, implementing the results requires you to first achieve the CEO’s three core priorities.\n- You must define a clear strategy that can be communicated and executed by others\n- You must hire exceptional direct reports capable of leading and executing the strategy\n- You must ensure the business has enough cash to pay your costs\nIf you can achieve these priorities, then all others are likely to be someone else’s: namely, your direct reports. This includes getting your input on their work, responding to emails, and running 1-1s. Therefore, filling capability gaps on your leadership team is essential and cannot be delayed.\nIn addition, investing in a Chief of Staff to whom you can delegate a meaningful proportion of inbound priorities that slip through the gaps of your other direct reports is essential. This role will speed up your development as a leader by helping focus your attention on high-level issues and staying out of too much detail.\nWorking on the mindset\nWhen I speak to some founders, their guilt about delegating or taking time out of the business is palpable.\nThey make up all sorts of disabling narratives about why this is impossible, unfounded, or unrealistic—at least for their ‘unique’ situation:\n- “If you’re not driving the team every day, you’ll send the wrong message”\n- “The team aren’t strong enough without your support”\n- “Taking time out of the business is self-indulgent”\n- “If your investors find out you have free time, they’d fire you instantly”\n- “All your long-term priorities can wait, there’s urgent stuff to be done”\nThis is fear talking. It’s the invisible force that keeps you trapped in your current setup. In order to begin to overcome this fear, you’ll need to balance any unhelpful narrative that comes up with a more realistic (and kind) interpretation:\n- “The clarity, accountability and direction you provide the team sends the right message”\n- “If a teammate isn’t strong enough, they can’t be on the team—and that’s your priority”\n- “Taking time out of the business can provide you with valuable perspective”\n- “Your investors aren’t interested in time spent, they are interested in outcomes”\n- “There’ll always be urgent stuff, so starting on your long-term priorities is now or never”\nYou’ll often hear about the need for business owners to spend time ‘on’ the business. However, the only way to not work ‘in’ the business 24/7 is to work on yourself first.\nMaking your time count\nIf you want to reduce the amount of time you spend with the team, you need to make sure you're focused on the right things. Here are three pieces of advice to ensure your time with the team is put to best use:\n1. Own Your Team Meetings\nIn contrast to 1-1s which serve your report’s needs, team meetings are there to serve yours.\nWhen the team meeting serves you, you can serve the team—by providing the accountability, clarity and direction they need.\nIf you aren’t entirely satisfied by your team meeting, change it. No-one else will. At the end of the meeting, you should have the information you need to run the business effectively.\n2. Set Up Accountability Structures\nIn its purest form accountability is ‘an ability to account for what’s happened’. Under this definition, any structure that provokes a leader to reflect and make commitments is a form of accountability.\nTeam retros, data reports and presentations can amplify the effects of accountability, even if you’re not there. CEOs often worry that data might take too long to collect… but that’s not your priority, it’s your team’s.\n3. Hunt for Elevator Moments\n‘Elevator Moments’ are the biggest impact a CEO can have in a meeting. These are the moments where the CEO helps their leaders to step out of the details and see the bigger picture.\n“Let’s remind ourselves about what we’re really trying to achieve here…”\nThe interaction may take less than a minute, but has a greater impact than all the discussions about details and problems.\nCEOs uniquely have the context to be able to do this, and spending time out of the business only makes this easier.\nThe door is already open\n“The freedom we seek is always available”– Bruce Tift, author of Already Free\nIf you’re unhappy in your role, or you feel like you’re not growing as you could be, you’re probably spending 80% of your time in the wrong place. If you’re too loyal to the things that made you successful in the past, you can eventually become imprisoned by them.\nBy clarifying your long-term priorities and acting on them now, you can achieve far more than you ever imagined. You can become the leader you aspire to be sooner, deliver more results for your company, and enjoy the free time you so desperately desire.\nThe door is open. There’s no ball and chain. You’re already free.\nOriginally published on August 16, 2023.\nHow do top founders actually scale?\nI’ve coached CEOs for 10,000+ hours—here’s what works.\nJoin 17,000+ founders learning how to scale with clarity.\nUnsubscribe any time.",

Convinced they have changed the company, they dash off excited to see what results they will generate in the upcoming quarter.

Pick one for the company that is bugging you and impeding your progress.\n-\nHow do I measure progress?

The secret of success is in the actions you take to move the KPI towards your goal, not in the measurement itself. Don't measure everything that moves; measure what you want. Rather than having 18-25 KPIs, just do 1 or 2. Focus on the actions, get value, succeed, and then pick a few more to focus on. Actually creating a repeatable and sustainable process, not doing an event.

    "content": "When it comes to your leadership, it’s important to be aware of the habits that may be hindering your team’s success. While we all have our own quirks and tendencies, some habits can be more harmful than others, particularly when it comes to leading a team.\nHere are five harmful habits that may be sabotaging your team’s success and what you can do about them.\nInfective communication: Poor communication can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and lack of collaboration. To improve communication on your team, make an effort to be clear and concise when communicating expectations and goals, and encourage open and honest dialogue among team members.\nAmbiguous goals: Procrastination can lead to missed deadlines, poor quality work, and increased stress. To combat procrastination on your team, set clear deadlines and expectations, and encourage team members to break large tasks into smaller, more manageable ones.\nMistrust: When you mistrust others, you turn into a micromanager. Micromanaging can lead to a lack of autonomy and creativity among team members. To foster a culture of trust and responsibility, give team members the freedom to take ownership of their work and make decisions.\nPoor delegation: Failing to delegate tasks can lead to overburdening and burnout among team members. To ensure that tasks are distributed evenly and efficiently, learn to delegate effectively and trust your team to handle responsibilities.”\nNegative mindset: As a leader, having a negative mindset and behavior can be contagious and harmful to company morale. To maintain a positive and productive culture, encourage a growth mindset and focus on solutions rather than problems.\nBottom line, being aware of and addressing harmful habits, you can create a positive and productive culture that supports success.\nLead From Within: Leaders who engage in harmful habits risk sabotaging their team’s success and hindering their own growth and development as a leader.\n#1 N A T I O N A L B E S T S E L L E R\nThe Leadership Gap\nWhat Gets Between You and Your Greatness\nAfter decades of coaching powerful executives around the world, Lolly Daskal has observed that leaders rise to their positions relying on a specific set of values and traits.

    "title": "Bottleneck #04: Cost Efficiency",
    "domain": "martinfowler.com",
    "age": "918 days ago",
    "content": "Before engineers rush into optimizing cost individually\nwithin their own teams, it’s best to assemble a cross-functional\nteam to perform analysis and lead execution of cost optimization\nefforts. Typically, cost efficiency at a startup will fall into\nthe responsibility of the platform engineering team, since they\nwill be the first to notice the problem – but it will require\ninvolvement from many areas. We recommend getting a cost\noptimization team together, consisting of technologists with\ninfrastructure skills and those who have context over the\nbackend and data systems. They will need to coordinate efforts\namong impacted teams and create reports, so a technical program\nmanager will be valuable.\nUnderstand primary cost drivers\nIt is important to start with identifying the primary cost\ndrivers. First, the cost optimization team should collect\nrelevant invoices – these can be from cloud provider(s) and SaaS\nproviders. It is useful to categorize the costs using analytical\ntools, whether a spreadsheet, a BI tool, or Jupyter notebooks.\nAnalyzing the costs by aggregating across different dimensions\ncan yield unique insights which can help identify and prioritize\nthe work to achieve the greatest impact. For example:\nApplication/system: Some applications/systems may\ncontribute to more costs than others. Tagging helps associate\ncosts to different systems and helps identify which teams may be\ninvolved in the work effort.\nCompute vs storage vs network: In general: compute costs\ntend to be higher than storage costs; network transfer costs can\nsometimes be a surprise high-costing item. This can help\nidentify whether hosting strategies or architecture changes may\nbe helpful.\nPre-production vs production (environment):\nPre-production environments’ cost should be quite a bit lower\nthan production’s. However, pre-production environments tend to\nhave more lax access control, so it is not uncommon that they\ncost higher than expected. This could be indicative of too much\ndata accumulating in non-prod environments, or even a lack of\ncleanup for temporary or PoC infrastructure.\nOperational vs analytical: While there is no rule of\nthumb for how much a company’s operational systems should cost\nas compared to its analytical ones, engineering leadership\nshould have a sense of the size and value of the operational vs\nanalytical landscape in the company that can be compared with\nactual spending to identify an appropriate ratio.\nService / capability provider: Across project management,\nproduct roadmapping, observability, incident management, and\ndevelopment tools, engineering leaders are often surprised by\nthe number of tool subscriptions and licenses in use and how\nmuch they cost. This can help identify opportunities for\nconsolidation, which may also lead to improved negotiating\nleverage and lower costs.\nThe results of the inventory of drivers and costs\nassociated with them should provide the cost optimization team a\nmuch better idea what type of costs are the highest and how the\ncompany’s architecture is affecting them. This exercise is even\nmore effective at identifying root causes when historical data\nis considered, e.g. costs from the past 3-6 months, to correlate\nchanges in costs with specific product or technical\ndecisions.\nIdentify cost-saving levers for the primary cost drivers\nAfter identifying the costs, the trends and what are driving\nthem, the next question is - what levers can we employ to reduce\ncosts? Some of the more common methods are covered below. Naturally,\nthe list below is far from exhaustive, and the right levers are\noften very situation-dependent.\nRightsizing: Rightsizing is the action of changing the\nresource configuration of a workload to be closer to its\nutilization.\nEngineers often perform an estimation to see what resource\nconfiguration they need for a workload. As the workloads evolve\nover time, the initial exercise is rarely followed-up to see if\nthe initial assumptions were correct or still apply, potentially\nleaving underutilized resources.\nTo rightsize VMs or containerized workloads, we compare\nutilization of CPU, memory, disk, etc. vs what was provisioned.\nAt a higher level of abstraction, managed services such as Azure\nSynapse and DynamoDB have their own units for provisioned\ninfrastructure and their own monitoring tools that would\nhighlight any resource underutilization. Some tools go so far as\nto recommend optimal resource configuration for a given\nworkload.\nThere are ways to save costs by changing resource\nconfigurations without strictly reducing resource allocation.\nCloud providers have multiple instance types, and usually, more\nthan one instance type can satisfy any particular resource\nrequirement, at different price points. In AWS for example, new\nversions are generally cheaper, t3.small is ~10% lower than\nt2.small. Or for Azure, even though the specs on paper appear\nhigher, E-series is cheaper than D-series – we helped a client\nsave 30% off VM cost by swapping to E-series.\nAs a final tip: while rightsizing particular workloads, the\ncost optimization team should keep any pre-purchase commitments\non their radar. Some pre-purchase commitments like Reserved\nInstances are tied to specific instance types or families, so\nwhile changing instance types for a particular workload could\nsave cost for that specific workload, it could lead to part of\nthe Reserved Instance commitment going unused or wasted.\nUsing ephemeral infrastructure: Frequently, compute\nresources operate longer than they need to. For example,\ninteractive data analytics clusters used by data scientists who\nwork in a particular timezone may be up 24/7, even though they\nare not used outside of the data scientists’ working hours.\nSimilarly, we have seen development environments stay up all\nday, every day, whereas the engineers working on them use them\nonly within their working hours.\nMany managed services offer auto-termination or serverless\ncompute options that ensure you are only paying for the compute\ntime you actually use – all useful levers to keep in mind. For\nother, more infrastructure-level resources such as VMs and\ndisks, you could automate shutting down or cleaning up of\nresources based on your set criteria (e.g. X minutes of idle\ntime).\nEngineering teams may look at moving to FaaS as a way to\nfurther adopt ephemeral computing. This needs to be thought\nabout carefully, as it is a serious undertaking requiring\nsignificant architecture changes and a mature developer\nexperience platform. We have seen companies introduce a lot of\nunnecessary complexity jumping into FaaS (at the extreme:\nlambda\npinball).\nIncorporating spot instances: The unit cost of spot\ninstances can be up to ~70% lower than on-demand instances. The\ncaveat, of course, is that the cloud provider can claim spot\ninstances back at short notice, which risks the workloads\nrunning on them getting disrupted. Therefore, cloud providers\ngenerally recommend that spot instances are used for workloads\nthat more easily recover from disruptions, such as stateless web\nservices, CI/CD workload, and ad-hoc analytics clusters.\nEven for the above workload types, recovering from the\ndisruption takes time. If a particular workload is\ntime-sensitive, spot instances may not be the best choice.\nConversely, spot instances could be an easy fit for\npre-production environments, where time-sensitivity is less\nstringent.\nLeveraging commitment-based pricing: When a startup\nreaches scale and has a clear idea of its usage pattern, we\nadvise teams to incorporate commitment-based pricing into their\ncontract. On-demand prices are typically higher than prices you\ncan get with pre-purchase commitments. However, even for\nscale-ups, on-demand pricing could still be useful for more\nexperimental products and services where usage patterns have not\nstabilized.\nThere are multiple types of commitment-based pricing. They\nall come at a discount compared to the on-demand price, but have\ndifferent characteristics. For cloud infrastructure, Reserved\nInstances are generally a usage commitment tied to a specific\ninstance type or family. Savings Plans is a usage commitment\ntied to the usage of specific resource (e.g. compute) units per\nhour. Both offer commitment periods ranging from 1 to 3 years.\nMost managed services also have their own versions of\ncommitment-based pricing.\nArchitectural design: With the popularity of\nmicroservices, companies are creating finer-grained architecture\napproaches. It is not uncommon for us to encounter 60 services\nat a mid-stage digital native.\nHowever, APIs that aren’t designed with the consumer in mind\nsend large payloads to the consumer, even though they need a\nsmall subset of that data. In addition, some services, instead\nof being able to perform certain tasks independently, form a\ndistributed monolith, requiring multiple calls to other services\nto get its task done. As illustrated in these scenarios,\nimproper domain boundaries or over-complicated architecture can\nshow up as high network costs.\nRefactoring your architecture or microservices design to\nimprove the domain boundaries between systems will be a big\nproject, but will have a large long-term impact in many ways,\nbeyond reducing cost. For organizations not ready to embark on\nsuch a journey, and instead are looking for a tactical approach\nto combat the cost impact of these architectural issues,\nstrategic caching can be employed to minimize chattiness.\nEnforcing data archival and retention policy: The hot\ntier in any storage system is the most expensive tier for pure\nstorage. For less frequently-used data, consider putting them in\ncool or cold or archive tier to keep costs down.\nIt is important to review access patterns first. One of our\nteams came across a project that stored a lot of data in the\ncold tier, and yet were facing increasing storage costs. The\nproject team did not realize that the data they put in the cold\ntier were frequently accessed, leading to the cost increase.\nConsolidating duplicative tools: While enumerating\nthe cost drivers in terms of service providers, the cost\noptimization team may realize the company is paying for multiple\ntools within the same category (e.g. observability), or even\nwonder if any team is really using a particular tool.\nEliminating unused resources/tools and consolidating duplicative\ntools in a category is certainly another cost-saving lever.\nDepending on the volume of usage after consolidation, there\nmay be additional savings to be gained by qualifying for a\nbetter pricing tier, or even taking advantage of increased\nnegotiation leverage.\nPrioritize by effort and impact\nAny potential cost-saving opportunity has two important\ncharacteristics: its potential impact (size of potential\nsavings), and the level of effort needed to realize them.\nIf the company needs to save costs quickly, saving 10% out of\na category that costs $50,000 naturally beats saving 10% out of\na category that costs $5,000.\nHowever, different cost-saving opportunities require\ndifferent levels of effort to realize them. Some opportunities\nrequire changes in code or architecture which take more effort\nthan configuration changes such as rightsizing or utilizing\ncommitment-based pricing. To get a good understanding of the\nrequired effort, the cost optimization team will need to get\ninput from relevant teams.\nAt the end of this exercise, the cost optimization team should\nhave a list of opportunities, with potential cost savings, the effort\nto realize them, and the cost of delay (low/high) associated with\nthe lead time to implementation. For more complex opportunities, a\nproper financial analysis needs to be specified as covered later. The\ncost optimization team would then review with leaders sponsoring the initiative,\nprioritize which to act upon, and make any resource requests required for execution.\nThe cost optimization team should ideally work with the impacted\nproduct and platform teams for execution, after giving them enough\ncontext on the action needed and reasoning (potential impact and priority).\nHowever, the cost optimization team can help provide capacity or guidance if\nneeded. As execution progresses, the team should re-prioritize based on\nlearnings from realized vs projected savings and business priorities.",

    "age": "918 days ago",
    "content": "It can sometimes feel hard getting through your agenda during your hour-long meetings — so then, how are you supposed to make a 15- or 20-minute meeting work?\nThis is both the main challenge and the benefit of holding a team huddle. Team huddles provide opportunities to surface important information, but with constraints that make sure teams use the time efficiently.\nBut how can you pull this off without your team huddle becoming just another recurring meeting? Or, even worse, another bottleneck to productivity? That’s what this article is going to look at.\nWhat is a team huddle?\nA team huddle is a type of short, recurring meeting that you'll typically use to check in with team members, align on project goals, and address any challenges or issues.\nAlso called a stand-up or scrum, team huddles are often held on a recurring daily or weekly basis. They're often done in-person, but there’s no reason they can’t also be done virtually. Regardless, their purpose is to improve visibility across the team and make it easier for everyone to work together.\nBenefits of regular team huddles\nMaking huddles a habit on your team is an effective way of improving productivity across all your projects. Here are some of their main benefits:\n- Better team alignment: Regular huddles are a great way to make sure everyone knows what they should be working on, understands any specific processes, and is aware of the team’s or project’s larger goals.\n- Improved communication: Not only do huddles make it easy to quickly ask questions or clarify issues, but they also eliminate the time-consuming emails and messages that would have otherwise been sent.\n- Increased camaraderie: By getting the team together to talk regularly, huddles can help bring the team together, give them an opportunity to educate one another, and even connect over their shared wins or losses.\n- Enhanced problem-solving: Huddles are a place where team members can easily bring up any challenges they’re having or roadblocks they’re facing. This helps ensure everything keeps moving forward efficiently.\n- Faster teamwork: Maybe best of all (at least for some people), huddles can be done quickly. About 15 minutes is all you should need to get everyone aligned and ready for the day.\nHow to run a team huddle meeting\nRunning effective team huddles can take practice — both for you and your team members. But as long as you follow a few simple tips, you can help maximize this time and turn it into a useful part of everyone’s day.\n1. Follow a simple agenda\nGiving your huddle some structure (and sticking to it) will help provide that you can accomplish what you want without the conversation going off the rails. One good way to do this is to build the standup around a specific set of questions, such as these three:\n- What did you do yesterday?\n- What will you do today?\n- Is there anything blocking you?\nAlternatively, you could make your focus even more specific:\n- What are your goals?\n- How are you accomplishing them?\n- What's your measure of success?\nOf course, you can use any set of questions, or even ditch them altogether for another format, as long as you’re able to craft an agenda that addresses what your team needs.\nTry the daily scrum meeting template\nThe daily scrum template helps teams easily check-in and track team progress. Ask the team huddle questions, visualize how tasks are coming along throughout the week or sprint period, and raise any concerns or roadblocks that may need to be resolved for the team.\n2. Keep the huddle short\nThe whole point of your daily team huddle is to help make it easier for everyone to work, so don’t take a big chunk out of their work day. Instead, keep the huddle as short as you can make it.\nAbout 15 minutes is the average amount of time most huddles are. This should be long enough to get everyone aligned and their issues resolved. If you find yourself pushing past 20 minutes, consider revisiting your agenda to see how you can make your meeting more concise.\n3. Try to hold the huddle earlier in the day\nIf possible, make your daily huddles a regular part of your mornings. Although afternoon meetings may allow team members to address the projects or issues they’re working on currently, they can also be an unwelcome intrusion in the middle of the day. Plus, they give team members less time to accomplish any action items afterwards.\nIn contrast, morning meetings help set the tone by making sure everyone is aligned, all roadblocks are removed, and every action item is clarified. Everyone will know exactly what they should be working on and how best to go about it. Plus, you’ll be more likely to have an energetic and engaged team that’s motivated to get their work done. This will help make sure the day gets started on the right foot.\n4. Focus on the essentials\nYou only have about 15 minutes, so there’s no time for things like greetings, icebreakers, or small talk. Instead, your job is to keep your team focused on running through your most important tasks.\nA good way to do this is to limit your huddle to action items only. That means this isn’t the place for any project planning or brainstorming. Save those for your weekly or monthly team meetings. If a team member insists on getting into the weeds during the huddle, let them know that you can meet with them afterwards to solve their problem to avoid wasting anyone else’s time.\n5. Establish a regular cadence for the huddles\nYou want your huddles to become a habit, something that your team can seamlessly incorporate into their day and week. If you’re holding them at random times, or whenever your schedule happens to be free, you’ll just make it harder for your team to prepare for them. Some people might be in the middle of a project, while others may be just wrapping one up. No one will be in the right mindset to get aligned.\nInstead, try establishing a regular time to meet for your huddle — then stick to it. We think the mornings are the best time, but pick a slot that makes sense for your team. Keep it up long enough and they’ll be showing up ready and prepared without even thinking about it.\n6. Huddles should be team-based, not project-based\nThe brevity and efficiency of huddles are one of their core benefits — but this will disappear if you require team members to sit in on three or four of them each day.\nTo prevent this, base your huddles not around each project (which can sometimes number in the dozens for each team member), but instead around each team. This way, you can help not only reduce the number of huddles, but also provide teams with an opportunity to manage their project workloads among themselves.\n🚀 Pro-tip: For a more project-based sync, try holding a working session.\n7. Make huddles mean something\nIt’s vital to remember that huddles are only as valuable as the results they achieve. You and your team may enjoy getting together each day to discuss your projects and work through your issues, but if this isn’t helping move your work forward, then you may just be wasting your time.\nIt’s up to the team leader or project manager to make sure each huddle actually has meaning. There are plenty of ways you can do this. By checking in with team members later to see how they’re doing with any action items they were assigned, you can make sure that they have everything they need to be successful. Likewise, by following up on any issues that were raised, you’ll show the team that these huddles lead to results.\n8. Standardize and track each huddle\nFinally, it’s always a good idea to track each huddle in a standardized format. This is just a simple but effective way of helping team members stay organized. They’ll be able to see what their action items are, know what everyone else is working on, and be able to check back on any resolved issues or roadblocks from previous days.\nWhile all this can be done over a video call or in a standard meeting room, a more visual format can make it easier to share information and keep people engaged. These Mural templates can help you get started and can easily be adapted for your next team huddle:\n- Team standup template: Easily stay in sync with your team and keep track of their goals.\n- Daily scrum meeting template: Keep ahead of project roadblocks and track team progress towards your sprint goal with a daily scrum.\n- Meeting notes template: Keep your meetings focused by documenting agendas, tracking decisions, and detailing action items.\nUse huddles to improve collaboration and help your team work better\nIt’s time to make the most of your 15 minutes. Although short, properly organized and executed team huddles can also be very sweet. By helping to quickly align your team, address their problems, and clarify what they need to work on, they can be the perfect way to start your day or week. Just remember to keep them brief, on topic, and relevant for everyone involved.\nBut there’s no reason you have to start from scratch.

    "content": "Run a Team Meeting with KPIs\nGeneral company updates or things they need to know are great to share with employees before the meeting. Then allocate a few minutes for any questions from the team about those topics. If your team meeting involves multiple departments, this is a great way to get information from them ahead of time instead of spending the first 20 minutes of your meeting getting updates from everyone. Everyone should have audio and video when working from home to get more team collaboration.\nRun a Team Meeting Where Making Decisions Makes Meetings Effective\nIt is hard for employees to know their roles in a meeting when it comes to decisions. Are they there to listen? Are they to provide input? Do you want to make this decision by consensus? Be sure to make clear in these scenarios who is ultimately responsible for making the decision and ensuring you have the team's support for the decisions being made and implemented. The purpose of a staff meeting is to solve problems, not create more of them, so solve everything you can while you are together as a team. Ensure that all action items are recorded and assigned to the proper employee.\nRun a Team Meeting with an Agenda\nIf you have a big project to discuss, don't leave it for the last five minutes of your meeting. If a conversation goes on too long, see what can be redirected to the next session or set a time to follow up on that topic after the team meeting. The weekly meeting facilitator will have to make some judgment calls in real-time as to whether it is worth continuing the discussion, getting it back on track, or tabling it. Individual team members should have the chance to participate in each agenda item that is relevant to them. The person taking the meeting minutes is often the best person to nudge the meeting back on track.\nPrepare for the Team Meeting\nA successful team meeting will have a leader who can facilitate the conversation, but that leader doesn't have to run the entire session. Once you've determined your agenda topics and meeting schedule, could you let your team know if they need to prepare to share information in advance? This is a fantastic opportunity to give team members a chance to lead discussions, share important updates, offer suggestions, and come away with action items for the next meeting. Still, they can only do that if they're prepared. Only spring a topic on them at the forum if you want a productive discussion. Feel free to bring any additional insight from your skip-level meeting questions.\nGet Better at Each Weekly Team Meeting.\nSeek feedback from your team on your meeting agenda. What worked well and what didn't? You can use that information to tweak your agenda to what works best for the team and their needs. This continuous feedback loop will ensure that your weekly team meetings get better each week. In work-from-home and remote teams, you should avoid conference calls when possible and use web conferencing software like Microsoft Teams or Zoom. Make sure that you start the meeting on time, clearly explain the purpose of the meeting, and get better each week. Pretty soon your bad meetings, turn into tolerable ones and eventually great meetings.\nA team meeting should be something the employees look forward to each week — a place where they can share their concerns, share ideas, ask questions, get valuable information, and feel that they are part of the overall process. 80% of your weekly meetings should be spent solving problems. Here is how to fix weekly meetings. Take some time to craft your agenda to make the most of that weekly team meeting slot and treat it as a weekly team-building exercise rather than something you just have to survive!\nIf you want to run the perfect executive team meeting, read this post, our check our learn section to learn more about the multiple types of meetings.\nNeed help getting your team aligned to achieve your growth goals?

    "title": "Performance Reviews And The Evolving Landscape Of Employee Engagement",
    "domain": "forbes.com",
    "age": "924 days ago",
    "content": "In the ever-evolving corporate arena, the interplay between employers and employees remains a fascinating dynamic, encompassing an array of pressing concerns such as the return-to-office debate and the emergence of \"quiet quitting.\" Amidst this backdrop, performance reviews have become a focal point of innovation in the ongoing employer-employee discourse.\nMajor industry players like Google, Amazon, Meta and others are pioneering innovative approaches to performance reviews, driven by the need to enhance productivity, manage costs, and foster a culture of growth.\nAt the same time, employee engagement has transitioned from a mere buzzword to a cornerstone of organizational strategy. Today's employees seek more than just a paycheck—they desire a sense of purpose, growth opportunities, and a supportive work environment. Engaged companies outperform their competition.\nMore Context\nAn increasing number of major companies are requiring employees to return to the office full or part-time. These return-to-office mandates are on the rise as worker productivity appears to be dipping down.\nAccording to Gallop, 56% of U.S. workers have jobs that can be done remotely. And 90% of U.S. employees who can work remotely don’t want to return to the office five days a week.\nGallup research during the aftershock of the pandemic found that remote-ready employees in collaborative jobs who work on-site two to three days per week are more engaged and have higher well-being.\nExceptional performance management matters. Outmoded performance management practices, with inflexible and often frustrating review processes, are not effective.\nShifting from a mindset of traditional to innovative performance management requires companies to think of managers as coaches rather than bosses. And when managers have well-timed performance conversations that reflect this sentiment, manager-employee interactions feel much more encouraging, engaging and rewarding.\nExamples At Zoom, Google, Amazon, Meta And Shopify\nPerhaps ironically, Zoom is calling employees back to the office. The company says workers near offices must come in twice a week as the remote-work namesake and former pandemic-era favorite seeks to generate faster growth.\nGoogle advanced the return-to-office push by using in-person attendance as part of employee performance reviews. This after having overhauled their performance review system last May which reduced performance reviews from twice to once a year. Managers meet with employees in a series of feedback check-ins throughout the year, with promotions happening twice yearly. During annual performance ratings, Google employees’ impact is ranked from “not enough\" to “outstanding” or “transformative.”\nAmazon's performance review procedure has long been known for its lack of transparency, even among its employees. However, reports last year revealed insights into how managers assess the performance of corporate staff.\nAs reported by Insider, managers gauge employees using Amazon's leadership principles, their current performance, and their potential for future growth. The evaluation process involves multiple criteria, such as comparing an employee's accomplishments for the year against the role's expectations, considering input from colleagues and the employee's self-assessment, and incorporating observations from managerial discussions with employees.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's ambitious \"year of efficiency\" is leaving no stone unturned within the company, and this drive for efficiency is making waves even in the realm of performance evaluations. Last July, the tech behemoth dispatched a message to its managers: identify underperforming individuals and promptly relay this information to the human resources department.\nFast forward to the early months of 2023, and the echoes of this directive are resonating as thousands of employees found themselves facing lackluster performance ratings, accompanied by trimming bonuses as well. While this might raise eyebrows, insiders reveal that Meta has never been one to shy away from stringent evaluations—a tendency that predates the pandemic.\nIn October 2022, Shopify shared plans to overhaul and innovate their performance review process. The new system is less vague and more “evidence-based.” People leaders participate in exercises to assess the current performance of their teams. This will help the company identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to address them.\nSecond, employees are asked to participate in a self-reflection exercise to share their thoughts on growth and development. This will help the company identify individual needs and create tailored development plans.\nThe company is also clarifying the type of work each employee does to standardize the language around jobs. This is intended to make it easier for employees to understand their roles and responsibilities—and for the company to make fair and equitable decisions about compensation and advancement.\nWhat To Do\nNine trends are predicted that organizations will have to confront this year, based on Gartner research:\n- “Quiet hiring” offers new ways to snag in-demand talent\n- Hybrid flexibility reaches the front lines\n- Squeezed by competing leader and employee expectations, managers need support\n- Pursuit of nontraditional candidates expands talent pipelines\n- Healing pandemic trauma opens the path to sustainable performance\n- Organizations push DEI forward amid growing pushback\n- Getting personal with employee support creates new data risks\n- Algorithmic bias concerns lead to more transparency in recruiting tech\n- Gen Z skills gaps reveal workforce-wide erosion of social skills\nIn today's competitive labor market, companies that want to attract and retain top talent need to focus on the most critical aspects of work:\n- Acquiring critical talent: Offering competitive salaries and benefits, as well as promoting a positive and supportive work environment. Companies should also make it easy for employees to learn and grow, and to advance their careers.\n- Supporting all employees holistically: This means providing employees with the resources they need to be successful, both professionally and personally. This includes things like flexible work arrangements, mental health support, and financial planning assistance, among others.\n- Ethically collecting and using employee data: In today's digital age, companies have access to more employee data than ever before. It’s important to use this data responsibly and ethically and to protect employee privacy.\nCompanies with highly engaged workforces outperform their peers by 147% in earnings per share according to Gallup. Companies that can successfully address these areas will be well-positioned to attract, engage and retain top talent and to differentiate themselves as employers of choice. They will also be better prepared to meet the challenges of the future of work.",

    "domain": "europeanbusinessreview.com",
    "age": "917 days ago",
    "content": "Leadership plays a crucial role in helping teams achieve their goals and delivering high-quality work. To build an effective high-performance team, the leader must adopt the right strategies and approaches that motivate and engage the team members. High performance business professional Aileen P. Charland will summarize some of the best practices she has observed effective leaders use to motivate and retain high-performing teams.\nSet Clear Expectations\nOne of the most important things leaders can do to build high-performing teams is to set clear goals, expectations, and performance metrics. Ensure that everyone on the team understands their responsibilities and role in achieving their goals. Clarity about individual responsibilities and expectations increases accountability and helps to avoid confusion and ambiguity. When team members know what is expected of them, they will deliver results that align with set targets.\nOn the other hand, unclear expectations can lead to frustration and resentment. Make sure team members have a clear understanding of the goals and objectives so that they can hit their targets with confidence.\nEncourage Collaboration\nHigh-performance teams work collaboratively and engage in open communication. Encouraging collaboration among team members creates a safe and inclusive environment for sharing ideas and feedback. When team members collaborate, they can leverage each other’s strengths and knowledge, which fosters innovation and creativity. Leaders can also encourage and facilitate knowledge sharing by setting a regular meeting schedule and encouraging brainstorming sessions.\nOne way to ensure collaboration is by creating a team charter. The charter should outline the team’s purpose, objectives, core values, and roles of each member. This will help to set the expectations for collaborative work culture within the team.\nEncourage Accountability\nAccountability is essential for high-performance teams as it keeps members on track and gives them a sense of responsibility for their performance. As the leader, you should set clear expectations and goals and provide regular feedback on progress towards these objectives. This will help keep team members motivated to meet their targets and succeed. Additionally, reward systems effectively encourage accountability among team members by recognizing outstanding contributions and accomplishments.\nFoster a Positive Team Environment\nThe team’s environment greatly impacts their performance. As the leader, you are responsible for fostering mutual respect and trust among members. This can be done by setting an example of positive behavior and creating an open space for dialogue and feedback. Additionally, recognizing successes individually and as a team will help boost morale and motivate team members to continue their best work.\nEncourage Learning and Growth\nHigh-performing teams are continually learning and innovating – this is essential for staying competitive in the market. As a leader, you should encourage team members to invest in their professional development, such as attending workshops or seminars related to their role. Additionally, enable opportunities for them to network with industry professionals and gain exposure to new ideas. This will help them grow their knowledge, skills, and expertise which is essential for delivering high-performance results.\nProvide Feedback and Recognition\nProviding regular feedback and celebrating wins are crucial to building and sustaining high-performing teams. Feedback is essential to improving team performance, while recognition is an important motivator that boosts morale and job satisfaction. Effective leaders deliver feedback regularly, constructively, and promptly, while recognition can take the form of employee appreciation, bonuses, promotions, team-building activities, or simply acknowledging a job well done. Feedback should be viewed as a coaching tool and a means of improving performance, not a criticism or condemnation.\nEmbrace Diversity\nEffective leaders embrace diversity and inclusivity. Diverse and inclusive teams are stronger, more innovative, and achieve better results. Leaders can embrace diversity by intentionally recruiting diverse team members, generating awareness and sensitivity to different cultures and backgrounds, and encouraging diverse perspectives and ideas. Leaders who embrace diversity in their team composition and values can significantly improve team decision-making.\nOn the other hand, effective leaders also prioritize team unity and collaboration. Encourage team members to work together to create a culture of respect, understanding, and cooperation. Create an environment that allows everyone on the team to express their ideas and opinions without fear of judgment or discrimination.\nLead by Example\nEarning the trust and respect of team members requires leaders to lead by example. Leaders can model the behavior they expect from their team members by embodying the organization’s values, ethics, and culture. Effective leaders are accountable, self-aware, and transparent while modeling the high performance they wish to see in their team members.\nIn addition, effective leaders demonstrate the same commitment to their teams as they expect from their team members. Through your actions, you should show that you are invested in the team’s success and willing to put in the hard work necessary to help them achieve their goals. Showing your support will inspire team members and create an environment of collaboration and trust.\nFinal Thoughts\nAileen P. Charland understands that high-performing teams are a product of good leadership and solid strategies. In today’s fast-paced and competitive business environment, effective leaders must be intentional about the culture, values, communication, and practices that will foster a culture of high performance. By emphasizing clear expectations, encouraging collaboration and accountability, providing a positive environment and feedback and recognition, embracing diversity, and leading by example, leaders can unlock the potential of their team members and achieve their goals. When leaders adopt sound leadership strategies, they can effectively motivate and inspire their teams to become high-performing and achieve success together.",

    "content": "Q: How do you manage turnover and staffing during strategic planning or plan refreshes?\nA: Managing turnover and staffing issues is never easy! This is especially true during strategic implementation.\nSo, how do you ensure that your new staff members seamlessly transition into your strategic process? We have three suggestions:\n1. Ensure your strategy is part of your organization’s culture and the responsibilities are shared across various departments\n2. Embed your strategic plan in your onboarding process!\n3. Walk your new team members through the historical context of the plan.\nDealing with staffing issues can be tricky and complex for any organization. It can feel especially disheartening for organizations who feel like they are just hitting their stride with their strategic plan implementation.\nAs roles change and people come and go, how can an organization effectively keep its strategic initiatives on track? Read on for the expert insight our Strategy Collaborative members provided during our AMA session.\nTip #1: Embed Strategy into the DNA of Your Organization\nThere’s a difference between a strategic plan as merely a document versus your strategic plan as an organic part of your organization.\nWhat we really mean is that a strategic plan isn’t just a document that’s reviewed annually and once over in an onboarding process. A strategic planning and implementation process that’s embedded in your organization looks something like this:\n- Your plan establishes a bold vision of the future and how you’ll get there.\n- Your plan has shared responsibility across your organization. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach, but the plan is owned by more than just 1-2 members of your organization.\n- Your organization reviews the performance of your KPIs monthly.\n- You run a quarterly review and refresh. 20% of the time you spend reviewing performance, 80% of the time focusing on how you will make process in the next quarter.\n- You use this opportunity to make strategic decisions.\nIf you can check the boxes above, onboarding team members into this process will be much easier with an established plan and rhythm.\nTip #2: Distribute Ownership of Your Strategy Across Multiple Levels\nWhen a small group of centralized leaders creates and drives the strategic plan, the impact of staff turnover is felt much more acutely.\nHowever, if the strategic planning process is embedded as part of the organization and there are multiple layers of participants contributing, your organization will be better insulated against the challenges of staff turnover while creating shared commitment.\nThe organization’s broad participation ensures that the strategy remains intact despite staffing changes.\nTip #3: Cover the Plan in the Onboarding Process\nNew staffing changes aren’t just overwhelming for the organization filling the roles, but also for the new hires stepping into them.\nThe success of your new hires obviously A dynamic and well-organized onboarding process, especially as it relates to the strategic plan, makes all the difference.\nBut, Don’t Overwhelm Your Newcomers\nAssigning too many responsibilities to a person who hasn’t started their role or understands the organizational structure can be counterproductive. Instead, assign specific tasks to roles, not individuals, to ensure a smoother transition for newcomers.\nPro Tip:\nInstead of linking strategic initiatives or responsibilities to specific individuals, consider attaching them to roles. This ensures continuity regardless of staff changes.\nGive Your New Staff Members a Voice\nWhile inheriting responsibilities is a natural part of stepping into a new role, it is vital to allow new staff to feel like they are part of the planning journey. Do this by:\n- Walking them through the historical context of their role and the goals their predecessor was assigned to.\n- Allowing your new team members to voice their opinions or insights about your plan.\n- Adding or editing initiatives where appropriate!\nUse Visual Tools and Alternative Forms of Onboarding Documents\nThere is a time and place for each specific type of onboarding medium. The 50-page document outlining your strategic plan is still important, however not everyone can digest information like that all at once.\nRather than overwhelming new staff with extensive documents, visual representations can quickly impart historical context, allowing for faster catch-up.\nVisual tools, like Miro, can provide an effective snapshot of ongoing strategic plans, making them more digestible for newcomers.\nStreamlined onboarding can mitigate the challenges of turnover. By providing new team members with the flexibility to review plans at their own pace, you ensure they engage with content when they’re most receptive.\nPro Tip:\nOne-page strategic plans are magic! Plus, completing this helpful guide can help you communicate your strategy with your entire team [and not just new team members!]",

    "content": "Insights from Peter Drucker's Iconic Book \"The Effective Executive\"\nThe Definitive Guide to Getting the Right Things Done\nStrategies and Techniques for Change Agents, Strategists, and Innovators\nThere’s only a handful of business books that I recommend to almost anyone. Peter Drucker’s The Effective Executive is on that shortlist. It’s one of the few books I try to re-read every couple of years.\nThe book's premise is that being an effective executive is not in managing others but in managing yourself. This is an empowering philosophy as we have complete control over our own behavior.\nWith that setup, here are a few of my key insights from The Effective Executive.\nA Stunning Introduction\nThe introduction to The Effective Executive is a concise, insightful, and actionable outline of personal businesses practices if I could only always do live these practices! A performance management system or leadership class from this first chapter.\nWhat made them all effective is that they followed the same eight practices:\nThey asked, “What needs to be done?”\nThey asked, “What is right for the enterprise?”\nThey developed action plans.\nThey took responsibility for decisions.\nThey took responsibility for communicating.\nThey were focused on opportunities rather than problems.\nThey ran productive meetings.\nThey thought and said “we” rather than “I.”\nThe first two practices gave them the knowledge they needed. The next four helped them convert this knowledge into effective action. The last two ensured that the whole organization felt responsible and accountable.1\nFor any team — business or otherwise, a leader who incorporates these eight practices into their approach will be a great leader.\nFocusing on just one of these, I learned something from “focus on opportunities rather than problems.” Is this just semantics in calling our problems “opportunities for improvement\"? No! Drucker outlines that executives need to be “scanning” for various market opportunities and that management meeting should focus first on opportunities and then, only when all opportunities are dealt with, are problems dealt with. This positive, leaning-forward posture toward the market does at least two things. First, it creates a customer and market orientation instead of an inward-facing orientation. Second, it creates an empowered organization to solve problems at the point of operation, versus one needing to be told how to fix a problem.\nRunning Productive Meetings?? What percentage of your work time do you spend in meetings? 25%? 50%? More? What percentage of these meetings are needed and productive?\n(At the bottom, I have added an appendix with a “meeting hygiene” manual. Let me know what you think)\n—Subscribe to The Digital Leader Newsletter for Free!\nDecision Making\nDrucker dedicates two chapters to decision-making. Two critical concepts are understanding if the situation is a generalized one in which we should seek a principle to make the decision or an exception with no underlying principle. He dives deep into understanding that most situations have options containing compromises. These options are more opinion-based than fact-based and thus are based on hypothesis. Peter gives the practical advice that opinions come with a plan to test the decision (since it is based on a hypothesis). This technique of seeing how a decision can be tested helps speed up decisions and minimize risk. Finally, Drucker outlines that a major part of decision-making, and typically overlooked, is figuring out how to put them into effect. Repeated communication is the key to putting decisions into effect.\nThey took responsibility for communicating\nCrowd Sourcing\nFor the rest of my review, here are a few insightful “customer reviews” from Amazon:\nKnow Thyself —\nWhere and how do I spend my time? Am I staying busy or achieving results? What are my strengths? Is there a system to my decision-making? Am I a reader or a listener? These are a few of the questions asked in my reading of The Effective Executive.\nAm I an executive?\nThere’s only one Drucker…\nAlthough his examples are dated, Drucker still lays out the clearest explanation and game plan for anyone who finds themself in the position of leading a company. This book is about leadership and management, and if you don't understand the difference, all the more reason to buy it.\nGreat advice on executive effectiveness\nI like, for instance, how he describes the taking of responsibility for decisions: a decision has not been made until people know: the name of the person accountable for carrying it out, the deadline, the names of the people who will be affected by it, and the names of the people who will be informed. Simple, isn't it?\nA penetrating observation is that in large organizations, people tend to be absorbed by what happens inside its boundaries and by perfecting a process regardless of the outside world. The removal of the executive from the customer base is fatal in the long run.\nAnother thought that I liked is that the effective executive does not make decisions by consensus but by what is right, even if the decision is not popular. The executive makes a few decisions, but powerful, rather than many razzle-dazzle decisions.\nWho was Peter Drucker?\nPeter Drucker ( November 19, 1909 – November 11, 2005) was an Austrian-American management consultant, educator, and author, whose writings contributed to the philosophical and practical foundations of the modern business corporation. He was also a leader in the development of management education, he invented the concept known as management by objectives and self-control, and he has been described as \"the founder of modern management\".\nDrucker's books and articles, both scholarly and popular, explored how humans are organized across the business, government, and nonprofit sectors of society. He is one of the best-known and most widely influential thinkers and writers on the subject of management theory and practice. His writings have predicted many of the major developments of the late twentieth century, including privatization and decentralization; the rise of Japan to economic world power; the decisive importance of marketing; and the emergence of the information society with its necessity of lifelong learning. In 1959, Drucker coined the term \"knowledge worker\", and later in his life considered knowledge-worker productivity to be the next frontier of management.2\nThe Digital Leader Newsletter Meeting Hygiene Manual\n(you can download this material at the bottom)\nLet’s all work at being a more “effective executive”.

    "content": "If you’re a regular V-Blog reader, you’ll know we’ve been shouting at anyone who’ll listen calmly discussing the recession and its impact on the marketing world.\nAlanna wrote a great post exploring how recessions can unleash a slew of unhelpful stakeholder feedback — and what you can do about it.\nIt got me thinking about another crucial part of the process: how creative ideation changes in a recession.\nBecause when you’re dealing with feedback on a piece of work, there’s a tangible thing you can have an arm wrestle over. But creative ideas are abstract by definition. Which means it takes trust in both the process and the practitioners to take something from pitch to production.\nTrouble is, the recession anxiety stakeholders are dealing with right now is kryptonite for creative confidence.\nSo how do you, as a creative marketer, steward anxious stakeholders through the creative ideation process? How can you get to quality work that’s actually going to have the impact that stakeholders so desperately crave right now?\nWell, this is by no means a tri-headed silver bullet — but here are three fundamental things you can do to aid that process.\n#1. Beware the path of least resistance\nThere’s a lot on the line for everyone right now — living costs, job security, economic uncertainty — to name but a few. Stakeholders might not admit it (they might not even realize it) but they’re probably a little scared.\nAnd when you’re pitching a creative idea in a recession, you probably are too.\nFear and uncertainty screw with our brain chemistry. When we’re scared, our prefrontal cortex essentially shuts down — which short-circuits our ability to think strategically.\nAnd in this hyper-alert state, the brain’s survival instincts default to “familiar: good”, “unfamiliar: bad”.\nThe result? Marketing ideas that might be received as novel or innovative in ‘peacetime’ can suddenly seem dangerous or reckless in a recession.\nBut what’s safe is seldom creative or impactful — and vice versa. So counterintuitively, the caution you’re exercising because it feels safer, is actually the bigger risk in marketing terms.\nIn this case, by taking the path of least resistance and just giving stakeholders ‘what they want’ — you’re effectively letting them down right when they need a steady hand the most.\nSo what can you do about it?\nGet much better at advocating for the unfamiliar.\nAnd no, that doesn’t mean running towards unnecessary risk. But it does mean helping your stakeholders process their risk aversion while finding ways to mitigate your own fear-based decision-making.\nThere are a number of ways you can practically execute this. One is presenting people with a scale of options: ‘safe’ to ‘moderate’ to ‘brave’ — seeding your preferred route as the ‘moderate’ option. This will not only demonstrate that your suggestion is considered, it’ll also give your stakeholders a reference point from which to judge the ‘extremeness’ of the idea.\nPeople like choice. This method allows stakeholders to feel like they’ve been responsible and gives the most creative ideas the best chance of survival.\nJust make sure your ‘safe’ and ‘brave’ routes are viable options that won’t crush your soul to execute — because they might end up as in the top spot.\n#2. Don’t train stakeholders to be untrustworthy\nAs marketers we know that the rationale behind a creative idea is just as important as the idea itself.\nIn fact, it might actually be more important. Creative ideas are subjective, but good rationale should feel like an irrefutable synthesis of factors that lead to a logical conclusion.\nAnd that’s exactly why it’s so easy to over-explain — especially in a recession, where certainty is at a premium.\nBecause when you feel the reflected fear of your stakeholders — it can make you doubt the ideas you’re putting forward.\nSo to signal confidence and show how much work has gone into a piece (both to the stakeholder and yourself), we can start to load our pitch decks with creative justification for just about every keystroke we’ve made.\nBut the result is often the polar opposite of the outcome we wanted.\nWhy? Because just like liars tend to pack their stories with unnecessary details (because it feels like substance), by over-explaining your ideas you begin to erode, rather than build, confidence. In fact, you might even start to make great work look like wooly creative concepts that need a cart-load of caveats to carry them.\nThe way out of this death roll? Ask yourself “is that annotation for them…or for you?”\nThis question can be a key step to rediscovering your ability to deliver work that’s researched, justified, and detailed — but not neurotically forensic.\nAs a by-product, it’ll help you see far more clearly which ideas are actually rooted in enough evidence to stand on their own… and which ones are kinda reliant on the over-explanation in order to function.\n#3. Don’t go for quick wins at the expense of long-term success\nRecession fear cuts both ways — and nowhere is this more apparent than in the recession-driven swing from brand awareness to sales activation.\nRecession anxiety can (ironically) cause quality standards to slip — precisely because people default to safe thinking. The success criteria changes from “What’s the best solution to this problem?” to “What’s likely to get approved?”. Likewise, stakeholders start to think “How can I justify this to the CFO” instead of “What is the best outcome we could reach here?”.\nThis happened with a client recently. Between us we unintentionally slipped into safety mode, patted each other on the back, and pushed brand awareness to the bottom of the agenda.\nAnd that’s really counterproductive. Because it’s super important for businesses to grow their brand in a downturn — especially the current one.\nWhen the post-pandemic economic bubble burst, the number of IPOs in the U.S dropped from a record 1035 in 2021, to just 181 in 2022. Maybe investors got more conservative. Maybe there’s a building mass of startups waiting for better market conditions to go public.\nEither way, things are relatively quiet now. And it’s cheaper (and less competitive) to make noise when markets slow down. When optimism creeps back into the market, it’s going to be harder to stand out than it is today.\nTo guide your stakeholders through that, as a creative marketer you’ll need to cultivate a ‘campaign mindset’ which will ensure you see value from the moves you make right now.\nThis isn’t just saying “spend loads of money on brand” (as nice as that would be). You’re saying, “now’s a good time to invest in brand building, so long as we’re intentional about the next steps in the journey that these brand building moves will kickstart”.\nPut it this way: companies in stable markets never regret prior investments in brand.\nSo, in a nutshell…\nWhen the recession fear hits, stakeholders will look to you for confidence, guidance, and clarity by way of increased creative scrutiny.\nIf you’re the creative marketer on a project it’s really important you admit your fear, respect the fear that stakeholders have, recognize how it might be influencing both of your decision-making, and take steps to mitigate it so you don’t inadvertently make things worse.\nBy maintaining your role as strategic advisor, being well researched but not neurotic, and fostering a campaign mindset — you’ll not only be able to keep delivering your best for your stakeholders in a recession.\nYou might just emerge from it a better marketer.\nEnjoyed this article?\nTake part in the discussion",

    "content": "What is it that I’m selling?\nBeing uncertain of your value proposition could certainly derail your prospecting efforts.\nUse these six questions in the prospecting phase, and by the time you put the value prop on the table, they’re going to be buying.\n**This blog is part of the 15 Reasons Holding Salespeople Back series**\n1. What matters more, what you think, or what the customer thinks?\nWe may look at the value proposition and think, this is weak, this is not right.\nBut it’s not what we think that matters—it’s what the customer thinks.\nWe may not want this type of car, or computer, or whatever it is, but that’s not for us to decide. It’s the customer making the purchase.\nWhat the customer wants determines the value proposition. Don’t allow your own perspective to determine the value proposition.\n2. Why have people bought from you before?\nWhen you start looking at this, ask yourself, why? There’s the value prop. That’s how you make numbers work.\nWhy have they bought from you before? Because you’ve helped them with something. If that’s in your value proposition, guess what? Your new prospects are going to want that.\nRead these 6 Things Customers Need Before They Buy\n3. Does the value prop match the outcome?\nOne of the reasons we prospect is because we want to understand if they have a desired outcome. Do they have a need? It may be a pain or a gain, but do they have something that we can help them with?\nAnd if it’s something we can help them with, and the value prop matches up, then we have a winning solution. I have no reason to walk away from my value prop if it matches their desired outcome.\n4. Are you solving a pain or a gain?\nIn the economic period we’re in right now, people are much more focused on solving a pain versus creating a gain. Value propositions take on more value if they help you deal with a pain. If I can help you deal with a pain, guess what? You’re going to win.\nThat’s great, but you’re going to have to stop and think about this because it’s going to impact the type of value proposition you share. You answer the ‘pain or gain’ question in the prospecting phase so that by the time you get to the point of delivering the value prop, you know exactly which it is that you’re selling and why the customer’s gonna buy from you.\n5. What’s the role of time in this offer?\nOne of the things that I always strive for very early on is I want to understand the relationship between time and why they are making a decision.\nBecause if I’m prospecting you, and you show an interest in what I have, but you’re not going make a decision for two years, what am I doing talking to you right now?\nYou see the role of time changes the value proposition dramatically.\n6. What would happen if the customer didn’t buy?\nMore than anything else, this question determines the value of the value proposition because if the customer doesn’t buy, what’s going to happen to their business?\nWhat’s going to happen to their life?\nIf I can begin to get them to see that in the prospecting phase, by the time I put the value proposition on the table, they’re going to be buying.\nWhat is ‘Land and Expand?’\nand How You Can Use It to Grow Your Sales\n+How to expand with new and existing customers by establishing yourself as a solution-provider.\nFind Ep. 123 on The Sales Hunter Podcast now.\nWhat sparks change?\nWhat generates revenue?\nMike Simmons advocates for a catalyst, a champion within the organization that deeply cares about the problem you can solve.\nListen to the conversation in Thursday’s episode, 8/10!\nThe Most Comprehensive Prospecting Training Available.\nIf you…\n- Need to save time and learn to leverage social media.

    "content": "To help you discover effective strategies for attracting top talent, we asked fourteen leaders and HR professionals for their best insights. From leveraging an employee advocacy program to maintaining consistent employment branding, these experts share their top strategies. Dive into the wisdom of CEOs, HR Managers and other leaders to enhance your talent acquisition efforts.\nLeveraging Employee Advocacy Program\nOne strategy that has been highly effective in attracting top talent to our company has been the implementation of an employee advocacy program. We believe our employees are our best brand ambassadors.\nWhen they are satisfied with their work environment, their role and the company culture, they express it, whether it’s during casual conversations with friends or on their social media platforms.\nThis authentic advocacy, seen and heard by potential candidates, acts as a powerful pull. People want to work where employees are happy and engaged, and our employees’ advocacy has proven to be a compelling testament to the positive work environment we strive to maintain.\nTheir genuine endorsement of our company attracts high-quality talent who are looking not just for a job, but for a place where they can grow, contribute and be part of a thriving community.\nMartin Potocki\nCEO, Jobera\nCommunicating Company’s Vision and Mission\nEveryone wants to grow in one sense or another. Employees join a company with the dream of taking their careers to the next level. They plan their career path and work to grow it. If a company itself has no plans to grow, then how can employees imagine their future in it.\nWhen hiring an employee, discussing the company’s vision and mission can boost the confidence of the candidate. This reassures them they are going to work in the right firm. Speaking about the company’s plan to grow significantly can attract top talent. As a result, talented candidates would like to be part of a growing company.\nMany interviews have been given and some companies were not joined because they did not talk about their vision and mission. Skipping this part in the interview can snatch a chance from you to attract the right candidates for the company. Motivate applicants to join the company by talking about its future growth\nSaikat Ghosh\nAssociate Director of HR and Business, Technource\nAdopting Passive Sourcing Strategy\nOne approach we’ve found that works incredibly well is passive sourcing.\nIt’s a growing part of our recruitment process, primarily because of the sheer level of skill that can often be identified via relevant candidates who otherwise may not apply for an open role.\nFor example, on platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn, you can often find incredibly passionate potential candidates who are utterly ingrained in their specific niche or role.\nWhile they may not be actively looking for a job, there’s nothing to lose by engaging with them and letting them know that they’d be a valuable asset to the team.\nWendy Makinson\nHR Manager, Joloda Hydraroll\nSourcing Based on Leadership Recommendations\nOur candidate sourcing has largely been done in-house, based on current leadership recommendations. One of our latest hires was actually a team package, which has turned out to be incredible.\nThe two just know how to work well off each other and have brought a game-changing viewpoint to the company.\nJarir Mallah\nHR Manager, Ling App\nRecognizing Achievements and Performance\nThe most influential strategy for attracting top talent is recognizing achievements and appreciating performance. Humans deserve timely appreciation and feedback.\nWhile negative feedback is often given quickly for the sake of company improvement, there is usually a gap in appreciating an employee’s performance.\nEmployee-recognition programs have been integrated as part of the company culture. Team leaders and managers are encouraged not to reserve this appreciation for formal events or annual awards, but to accolade any achievement by any member promptly.\nThis approach improves the satisfaction rate and the overall performance of the employees, as peers are more focused on performing well.\nTimely appreciation and recognition have proven to be a win-win situation, as there has been a visible improvement in the performance of the employees, resulting in tremendous growth for the company.\nSandeep Kashyap\nCEO and Founder, ProofHub\nUnleashing Puppy Power and Innovation Time-Off\nAt our company, we’ve mastered the art of “unleashing the puppy power.” Yep, you heard it right. We have an office dog program that woofs its way into the hearts of potential employees.\nStatistics show that 75% of job seekers are more likely to apply for a position at a pet-friendly workplace. Plus, who can resist those wagging tails and adorable puppy eyes?\nBut wait, there’s more! We also offer “Innovation Time-Off,” where employees can dedicate 20% of their work hours to their passion projects. This freedom to explore their creative genius has attracted some stellar talents who are now our star performers\nHimanshu Sharma\nCEO and Founder, Academy of Digital Marketing\nFostering a Growth-Oriented Culture\nAt Authors On Mission, one effective strategy for attracting top talent has been fostering a growth-oriented culture. We prioritize personal and professional development, offering learning opportunities, mentorship and clear paths for advancement within the organization.\nThis culture resonates with ambitious individuals who are not only seeking a job, but a place where they can grow, learn, and make a significant impact. We have found that top talent is often drawn to environments where they are challenged, recognized for their contributions and given room to innovate.\nBy promoting a culture of growth, we’ve been able to attract highly skilled individuals who align with our mission and contribute to our collective success.\nVikrant Shaurya\nCEO, Authors On Mission\nExpanding Talent Pool with Remote Work\nIngredient Brothers is a fully remote team—remote equals borderless. By default, this provides us access to a wide range of skills and expertise, effectively expanding our talent pool and ensuring that we have the most qualified individuals for any role, regardless of their geographical location. This allows us to achieve exceptional outcomes and succeed in the ever-changing business environment\nEran Mizrahi\nCEO and Founder, Ingredient Brothers\nPrioritizing Sales Skills Over Specific Roles\nOne strategy effective at attracting top talent to our organizations has been looking for great salespeople rather than medical device sales reps.\nOur motto has always been this: if you’re a successful sales rep, we can teach you about our device manufacturers’ products, benefits, features, and anything you need to know about hospital decision-makers.\nTaking this approach has opened the door to potential candidates we can choose from, which has been key to casting a wider net and growing our business.\nJohn Mooney\nPresident, IML\nSeeking Like-Minded Individuals\nOne strategy that has been effective is to look for like-minded individuals who share similar values. I like to look for psychologists who practice similar therapy modalities and, or ones who complement the expertise of others on our team. Doing so has always allowed us to find the right fit for our practice.\nAzmaira Maker, Ph.D.\nFounding Director, Aspiring Families\nSustaining an Inclusive Work Environment\nCompany culture can significantly affect job happiness and satisfaction among employees. Many people desire employment in an inclusive work environment that values and honors employee diversity.\nThe workplace should allow them to be at ease and work with no disturbance at their own pace while keeping track of daily goals. Maintaining this type of hindrance-free environment in the workplace helps keep top talents within the organization.\nHowever, it’s important to keep in mind that supervision at every step and level of the organization is necessary to maintain this culture.\nKelvin Wira\nFounder, Superpixel\nUtilizing Social Media for Talent Attraction\nTraditional recruitment avenues have their strengths, yet our agency has found remarkable success by turning to social media—specifically, Facebook—for talent attraction. This strategy has proven to be a game-changer, especially for reaching out to potential candidates embedded in rival firms, and it is considerably more cost-effective than using platforms like LinkedIn or hiring professional recruiters.\nFacebook’s advanced advertising capabilities allow for the delivery of tailor-made job adverts to a sharply defined audience, including those currently working for competitors. Compelling and pertinent ads draw in superior candidates who might not actively seek a new job—effectively accessing the reservoir of passive talent.\nThis cost-saving approach has slashed hiring costs and consistently brought in a steady stream of high-quality applicants, underscoring the importance of considering non-traditional routes in the rapidly growing tech landscape.\nShane McEvoy\nMD, Flycast Media\nCrafting an Authentic Employee Value Proposition\nHaving an Employee Value Proposition (EVP) that is authentic, differentiated, and summarizes the best of what you have to offer talent is the first step towards attracting top talent to any organization. Why? An authentic EVP conveys the unique essence and identity of the organization, reflecting its core values, mission, and culture. In today’s competitive job market, where candidates have many options, authenticity is key.\nDifferentiation is equally crucial. Top talent is in high demand, and organizations must stand out from the crowd to attract and keep the best candidates. A well-crafted EVP showcases the unique attributes that make your organization an exceptional place to work.\nFinally, an effective EVP helps organizations align their internal and external strategies. By consistently delivering an authentic and differentiated EVP across all touchpoints, from recruitment campaigns to company culture initiatives, organizations can attract and retain the very best.\nNicole Fernandes\nSenior Director, Employer Brand, and Culture, Blu Ivy Group\nMaintaining Consistent Employment Branding\nEvery company should have consistent employment branding in today’s tight labor market. Just like marketing to a customer, it takes seven times for your brand to be trusted for a worker to come to apply for an open position. Companies that neglect their employment branding are going to lose their edge in this war for talent.\nAndrew Crapuchettes\nCEO, RedBalloon.work\nAuthors\nRecruit Smarter\nWeekly news and industry insights delivered straight to your inbox.",

    "domain": "forbes.com",
    "age": "944 days ago",
    "content": "Thinking about how to best develop your leaders? Is doing so an investment worth making?\nA Metrix Global study found that executive coaching has a 788% return on investment (ROI) based on factors including increases in productivity and employee retention.\nWhere else can you possibly get this kind of return?\nWhat kind of results can you expect through providing coaching at work? Here’s some interesting data.\nThe International Coaching Federation (ICF) reports the following statistics on the benefits of executive coaching:\n· 70% increase in individual performance\n· 50% increase in team performance\n· 48% increase in organizational performance\nOrganizations that offer training alone experience a 22% increase in productivity, but when combined with coaching, that figure rises to 88% (Gerald Olivero, Denise Bane & Richard Kopelman, Public Personnel Management).\nWhy Your Results May Vary\nOf course, it would be great if coaches could guarantee you these kinds of returns. Here’s why your mileage may vary.\n1. You can’t successfully coach people who don’t want to be coached. Quite often, the people who are assigned coaches are the very people who have little interest in self-improvement, which may help explain they need a coach in the first place. However, here’s the thing. You can’t want more for someone than they want for themselves. No matter what you do, if they’re not interested in self-improvement, it won’t matter.\nWhat you should be doing is investing in your leaders who have expressed a desire to keep on learning and growing.\n2. The coachee lacks self-awareness and openness to change. No matter what anyone says or does, the coachee doesn’t see it that way. Self-awareness is not something a coach can teach someone, nor can they teach someone to be receptive to feedback. No matter how much effort (or money) is put into trying to help the client be more self-aware, there is little that a coach can do to get through. In cases like this, a psychologist may best serve the client.\n3. The coach isn’t qualified. There are no barriers to entry in the field of coaching, which means anyone can hang out their shingle and call themselves a coach. During unsettling economic times, like we’re currently experiencing, many people in transition decide to call themselves a coach. Some may have taken an online course or two. When you combine the completion of a well-known course with their experience, they appear to be more skilled than they are.\nWhen selecting a coach, be sure this person has the depth and experience to provide you with the results you seek and the ROI you deserve.\n4. The person you want to be coached doesn’t need a coach. What they need is complete honesty from you. If you’ve made a hiring mistake or this person is no longer the right person for the job, do the right thing—release them. Don’t waste your money or their time going through the motions when you already know the end result.\n5. The boss isn’t engaged. The executive’s leader plays a central role in the coaching process. We have seen repeatedly that when the boss is engaged in the coaching, the odds of success increase dramatically. We’ve also noticed that when the boss isn’t involved, the person being coached often flounders. Before investing a dime, be sure the boss of the person who will be coached is fully onboard.\nOn a more positive note, when someone asks for a coach, they are well on their way toward a highly successful coaching engagement that will pay dividends for years.",

    "content": "As businesses continue to evolve and adapt to an ever-changing landscape, the debate surrounding the pros and cons of remote working rages on. So while some studies suggest that almost three quarters of professionals feel happier when working remotely, for instance, others point to a chronic disconnect between managers and employees concerning the benefits of remote work, with many organizations still wary of committing to a ‘work from anywhere’ culture.\nSo, is hiring remote employees the right move for your business? In this post, we’re diving deep into the intricacies of remote work, weighing the benefits against the drawbacks and helping you make an informed decision about embracing the remote revolution. Let’s get started.\n5 Pros of Hiring Remote Employees\nAccess to a Wider Talent Pool\nRemote work has eliminated the constraints of location, allowing companies to tap into a broader and more diverse talent pool. They are no longer limited to hiring within the proximity of a physical office. This diversity is valuable as it brings in fresh perspectives and innovative ideas, enhancing business innovation\nThe ability to hire employees globally, rather than just locally, is a significant advantage. This becomes particularly useful when expanding into international markets. For instance, if you’re a US-based company looking to establish a presence in the UK, you can hire internationally to access local expertise, gaining a deeper understanding of market trends and nuances.\nIncreased Productivity\nWhile employees and managers may not be completely aligned when it comes to determining whether remote work is better or worse for productivity, several studies show that those who work remotely feel more productive as a result — in fact, as many as 90% of employees feel they’re at least as productive (if not more so) when working remotely compared to in the office.\nA primary reason for this is that remote work empowers employees to work when (as well as where) they feel most productive. Instead of being restricted by rigid schedules, they can usually pick and choose the makeup of their working day: ‘morning people’ can start and finish early, for example, while those who typically hit their stride later in the day can continue working while most others have clocked off.\nCost Savings\nOf course, one of the advantages of remote work that most businesses find impossible to ignore is its capacity to save costs. By reducing the need for ample office space — or doing away with it altogether if you’re prepared to go fully remote — you can save on overheads such as rent, utility bills, maintenance costs, and equipment.\nBut that isn’t the only way remote work can save you money. Companies who work remotely may see a reduction in employee turnover of up to 25%, meaning they’ll spend less replacing them — recruitment can be expensive and time-consuming. Check out this guide from Draycir on all the ways working remotely can save companies money.\nImproved Work-Life Balance\nAs more and more of us were introduced to the possibility of remote work, many of us discovered perhaps its most significant personal benefit: a vastly-improved work-life balance. Remote work removes long, stressful commutes from the equation and allows employees to enjoy a more flexible approach to their work and home lives.\nIt also enables them to incorporate other lifestyle factors (such as childcare, medical appointments, and even small things like home deliveries) into their day without these impacting their work. This uptick in work-life balance is undoubtedly a boon for employers, too, since a happier, healthier employee is likely to take less sick days, feel more engaged in their work, and ultimately be more productive.\nEnvironmental Benefits\nWith our society becoming increasingly eco-conscious — 60% of global consumers rate sustainability as a key factor when purchasing goods, for example — many businesses continue to strive to find ways to reduce their carbon footprints and mitigate their impact on the environment.\nThis is another area where remote work can offer an advantage. When the world shut down in 2020, air pollution decreased and water quality improved — environmental changes that can at least in part be attributed to a shift towards remote working. Removing commutes can cut greenhouse gas emissions, while businesses will have less need to heat and light office spaces.\nThe Drawbacks\nCommunication and Collaboration Challenges\nWhile remote technology has undoubtedly come on leaps and bounds in recent years (video conferencing technology is now ubiquitous, cloud computing allows us to access files and information from anywhere, and project management software enables efficient allocation of tasks), it can be argued that it still presents challenges when it comes to communication and collaboration.\nFor instance, while more than three quarters of meetings are now conducted virtually, it’s not quite as easy to pick up on subtleties of tone and body language, which may lead to misunderstanding and miscommunication. And that’s ignoring the fact that some employees may simply not feel altogether comfortable using video conferencing technology, meaning they might be less eager to express themselves in virtual environments.\nManaging Remote Employees\nRemote work environments are built on trust. Since as a manager you can’t see your employees performing their day-to-day duties as you would in an office, you need to trust that they’re working productively, managing their time effectively, using company resources responsibly, and generally being a reliable employee.\nThis trust doesn’t come naturally to all leaders, however, and it can make managing remote employees a challenge. Less visibility of their output may mean less involvement in their work, for example, which can make it difficult to manage their development and measure their progress. Time-tracking software can help with this, enabling managers to gain visibility of tasks and projects their employees are working on.\nSecurity Concerns\nWhen companies were forced to quickly adopt remote working practices in light of the global pandemic, one of the primary concerns of such a rapid shift was security: remote work is heavily reliant on cloud technology, which enables resources and programs to be accessed and shared by multiple employees across the web. But does this mean it’s less secure?\nThe truth is, cloud services typically offer end-to-end encryption, but that doesn’t mean remote working is fully secure, particularly when employees are accessing company information from their own devices or using public Wi-Fi. More employees working in more locations also means more endpoints, meaning the potential attack surface is theoretically larger.\nIsolation and Disconnection\nWhile the flexibility and independence offered by remote working is generally seen as a good thing, it often means employees spending large amounts of time working alone. Many of them may be fine with this, of course (naturally, some employees prefer working independently over collaboration), while for others, feelings of isolation can creep in.\nThe reality is, while virtual meeting technology has advanced and messaging apps (such as Flock or Slack) are widely used, they simply can’t replicate the natural chatter that occurs in an office environment, from the occasional ‘water-cooler’ conversations to quick-fire work-related questions.\nBlurring of Boundaries\nWe’ve covered the benefits of remote working when it comes to work-life balance, but there’s a potential downside to working from the place you also call home: as an employee, it can be difficult for to separate your work and home life, meaning the lines are often blurred, it’s not always easy to ‘switch off’, and you may end up working longer hours than your office-based counterparts.\nBusinesses may rejoice in the news that their remote employees might be clocking up more hours at their desks, but they shouldn’t be so fast to celebrate this fact: employees who frequently work long hours and don’t give themselves time to relax are far more likely to experience burnout, which will only hamper their productivity and cause them to become disengaged.\nAuthors\nMatthew Willis\nA UK-based digital copywriter, Matt is a skilled and passionate scribe with a keen interest in an array of subjects; his varied written work can range from deliberations on advances in the tech industry to recommendations about the top wildlife-spotting destinations.

    "content": "12 Guiding Principles on the Pathway to Value-Led Pricing\nDo the executives on the front lines of your firm have a clear, unequivocal understanding of the principles that guide your commercial decisions?\nThe firms who are stuck in the outmoded paradigm of selling hours cave in at the first objection of well-trained professional buyers, because they only know how to discuss and defend their costs.\nOn the other hand, the progressive firms that have a genuine understanding of the value they create have the confidence to follow specific rules of engagement during the process of setting and discussing remuneration. By proclaiming their commitment to modern pricing methodologies based on the value they create rather than the costs they incur, these firms are putting stakes in the ground that not only help them create healthier margins but strongly differentiate them from the countless other firms caught in the commercial gridlock caused by hourly billing.\nOnce you have committed to modern pricing, it’s essential to memorialize the principles that underpin your new revenue model. Here are some prominent examples from agencies who have made the compensation transformation:\nWe will price our services based on the value we provide rather than the hours we work. We will stop selling inputs and sell outputs or outcomes. This is the cardinal principle of modern pricing. It acknowledges the foundational fact that clients don’t buy our efforts; they buy solutions to business problems.\nIn remuneration discussions, we will use the language of value in place of the language of cost. Based on the power of language to influence behavior change, we now use the word “price” instead of “cost.” We have also discontinued any reference to hours, staffing plans, FTEs, labor, or other references to internal costs.\nWe will begin each new engagement with an in-depth understanding of Scope of Value before we execute a Scope of Work. Because agencies and clients alike are too prone to jump straight into execution of program elements without first defining what success looks like, we begin each engagement with a “success workshop” that defines the key predictive indicators that drive the solutions we develop.\nWe will always provide pricing options. In place of a single take-it-or-leave it price, we always offer multiple ways for our clients to say “yes.”\nWe will never lower our price without also subtracting value. We will downsize instead of discount. Reducing our price without also reducing scope destroys one of our most valuable commercial assets: our pricing integrity.\nWe will trade the standard hourly rate card for a “pricing stack” — a variety of different ways we capture the value we create for our clients. We explain to our clients and prospects that our business is built on a variety of different revenue streams that can include such approaches as dynamic pricing and subscriptions, all of which are designed to maximize the alignment of economic incentives between the agency and our clients.\nWe will identify opportunities to benefit from varying levels of risk and reward and create a diversified portfolio of remuneration agreements. With the right kinds of clients under the right circumstances, we will display the necessary self-confidence to accept a degree of risk in our compensation arrangements. We are willing to bet on our own success, knowing that a diversified portfolio always produces higher average returns.\nBeyond \"work for hire,\" we will develop new revenue streams based on new and existing intellectual property. As a professional services firm, we understand we are essentially a fixed cost business, which means our job is to find constantly new and better ways to monetize the expertise and intellectual capital that resides within our firm.\nWe will define and manage scope not as hours worked, but as outputs delivered or outcomes achieved. Because we price based on outputs and outcomes instead of inputs, our workflow management practices have changed accordingly. Our project managers define and manage scope as outputs delivered and milestones met — not hours worked.\nWe have traded the practice of costing from the bottom up for an approach that determines pricing from the top down. While costing is a calculation, pricing is a judgment — a strategic decision that starts with the question of perceived value to the customer. Accordingly, we have institutionalized pricing as a core competency separate from finance.\nWe will never enter into a pricing discussion we’re not willing to walk away from. We understand that unless we are willing to pass up an opportunity (and our prospective client knows it), we have no real pricing leverage.\nWe will view each new client relationship as an opportunity to experiment with (and learn from) value-led pricing. We believe that every new client is a chance to do something different in regards to pricing methodologies and approaches. We try to devote the same level of creativity to pricing and compensation as we do to solving our clients’ marketing problems.\nThe ingenious American investor Warren Buffet once observed that even if your firm has enough money, it can never have enough reputation. Your revenue streams aren’t your highest value; the principles that create them are.",

    "content": "By Thomas Keil and Marianna Zangrillo\nAs a CEO with aspirations, it’s impossible not to admire the trajectory of Microsoft’s Satya Nadella. Ascending to the role in 2014 as a relatively unknown executive within the company, Nadella has marked his tenure at the helm of the tech giant with successive accomplishments.\nHis visionary leadership resurrected Microsoft from a faltering giant to a pioneering force in tech and business. Through its commercial partnership with OpenAI, the corporation reasserted itself at the forefront of the industry and on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.\nWhat’s underpinned Nadella’s success? His ongoing transformation of Microsoft’s leadership team.\nFor years, Microsoft’s corporate culture had been marred by combative factions, which Nadella aptly described as “warring gangs.” As CEO, Nadella set out to develop a new leadership team ethos, one that married the intensity of competition with the potency of effective collaboration. Maintaining this often-fragile balance has been in the center of Nadella’s leadership, resulting in a decade of lauded achievements.\nDodging the Pitfalls of Success\nStill, as any veteran CEO knows, the path to sustained success is often lined with pitfalls. Our research suggests that success, especially continual success, can paradoxically plant the seeds of downfall. Leadership teams may fall into the trap of complacency, creating echo chambers that amplify past success formulas while rejecting disruptive, future-oriented ideas.\nThe question is: How can a CEO steer clear of these hazards to ensure the long-term effectiveness of their leadership team?\nWe’ve identified four fundamental pillars that contribute to a leadership team’s sustained performance: alignment with strategic goals, effective performance management, team renewal and relevance, and agility.\nPillar 1: Alignment with Strategic Goals\nMaintaining alignment within the leadership team is not a one-time task; it’s a continuous challenge for CEOs. The never-ending flow of new issues, obstacles, and opportunities can cause priorities to wildly diverge, which can splinter a team’s focus and fuel disjointed decision-making that hampers progress.\nTo avoid this fate, CEOs must diligently and consistently ensure their teams share an understanding of the industry’s challenges and the strategic direction the company needs to take in response.\nThis alignment allows teams to quickly identify and address any areas of divergence that could paralyze the organization or stifle its reactions. In essence, strategic alignment is the backbone that supports the body of a successful leadership team, promoting agility, coherence, and unified decision-making.\nPillar 2: Effective Performance Management\nWhen implemented effectively, performance management is a powerful tool to maintain alignment, even within the top ranks of a corporation.\nFor instance, Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications behemoth, has leveraged a rigorous performance management framework to align all employees, including leaders, with corporate objectives. This system rewards excellent performance and swiftly addresses underperformance, creating a culture of accountability.\nThe core of performance management lies in clearly defining goals and setting corresponding performance expectations backed by incentives.\nAll goals, objectives, and tasks should be intrinsically motivating. Incentives, however, should be viewed as a communication tool to highlight what excellent performance looks like, rather than a method to steer behaviors. This approach is particularly crucial for younger generations of leaders, who often value the meaningfulness of their goals as much as, if not more than, financial rewards.\nPerformance expectations should be ambitious yet realistic, pushing team members to strive for more while keeping them grounded. These expectations should be monitored, adjusted, and measured at both individual and team levels, with appropriate consequences drawn from the results—rewarding success but also clearly identifying failure.\nPillar 3: Team Renewal and Relevance\nA high-performing team must continuously evolve and remain relevant in the face of new developments. Even when a leadership team is aligned and performing well, its relevance can diminish over time.\nLaurent Freixe, executive vice president and CEO of Latin America for Nestlé, eloquently expressed this predicament, stating that over time, people tend to slip into cruise control, stop questioning themselves, stop listening to their team, and blur the line between their personal agenda and their role in the team.\nTo counter these tendencies, leaders must focus on several practices:\nDevelop individuals and the team: CEOs should stress the importance of developing new skills and provide the resources to make it happen, such as personal development plans, coaching, and training opportunities.\nReorganize the team structure: Regular structural changes within the leadership team will push new topics to the forefront and pressure the group to strive for growth.\nRotate team members: Even without structural changes, rotation within the leadership team can stimulate new learning and foster the development of new capabilities.\nIntroduce new team members: Infusing the team with new blood by introducing new members can instill novel ideas and shake up the status quo.\nInstitute tenure limits: Setting a limit on leadership team tenure prevents ossification and motivates the wider workforce by indicating that opportunities for advancement will arise.\nPromote diversity: Encouraging diversity within the leadership team—including gender, educational background, upbringing, and corporate and non-corporate experiences—enables the team to identify more opportunities and more effectively deal with challenges.\nSet the right tone: CEOs should promote a culture of constant renewal, preparing the team to anticipate and respond proactively to discontinuities.\nPillar 4: Agility and Bold Decision-Making\nCertain situations, like technological disruptions or shifts in societal expectations, demand more than just maintaining relevance. They require a complete reevaluation of the leadership team and their approach. Navigating such changes calls for agility, foresight, and, often, bold decision-making.\nLooking Ahead\nBuilding a strong leadership team is merely the start of the journey. To achieve and maintain success over the long term, a CEO must constantly assess and finetune their team. Microsoft’s revival under Satya Nadella’s leadership illustrates the potential of this approach, serving as an instructive blueprint for ambitious CEOs.",

    "content": "Wartime CEO: Running a War Room (1 of 2)\nWritten by Dave Bailey\nIf your company faces an existential threat, read this.\nAll bets are off.\nThat lead investor just pulled out.\nYour cost of acquisition just doubled.\nYour biggest customers are leaving.\nYou stare at the spreadsheet. Nothing adds up. Without swift action your runway will shrink until a crash is imminent.\nWhat do you do when your worst-case scenario becomes a reality?\nWelcome to wartime\nIn The Hard Thing About Hard Things, Ben Horowitz paints a vivid picture of a wartime CEO up against an ‘imminent existential threat’.\nIn the 12 years building tech companies, I did more than my fair share of layoffs. I've shut down companies, fired co-founders and had investors pull out at the last minute.\nBut as a CEO coach for many years, I've seen even worse.\nMike Tyson said, “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.” And that’s why I’m writing this series: to give you a blueprint on how to react when life deals you a painful blow.\nThe series comes in two parts:\n- Part 1: Running a War Room (attack)\n- Part 2: Making Cuts (retreat)\nAttack: running a war room\nWar rooms are used by military leaders to discuss tactics and strategies in a state of war. In your case, you’ll create a dedicated space for your team to work intensely on your plan of attack. If you have an office, you might take over a meeting room, otherwise it might be a dedicated video-conference link.\nWhen you think of military operations, you may think of a controlling leader with thousands of soldiers following their orders without question, but the modern military couldn't be further from that. When I interviewed British Army Officer-turned-CEO, Paul Ford, back in 2020, he clarified it for me:\n“People think that [in the army] there’s someone who tells someone who tells someone… but it isn’t like that. Wars are chaos, so the concept of empowerment is entirely built into the model. It’s called Mission Command: you tell people what you want to achieve, not how to do it. [In a war], they could be cut off from communications and have to use their initiative.”\nMission Command, advocated by the militaries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, is based on seven core principles:\n- Competence\n- Mutual trust\n- Shared understanding\n- Commander’s intent\n- Mission orders\n- Disciplined initiative\n- Accepting risk\nThese principles are extremely helpful when running your war room. I’ll run through each of the seven principles, and explain how they can apply to your war room.\nAs you read on, think of yourself as commander, rather than CEO. After all, we’re at war.\n1) Competence: assemble your best leaders\nMission Command relies on the competence of you and your leaders. It’s critical that the teammates you assemble in the room are your best and brightest.\nYou must also show competence as a commander. Retired US Army Colonel, Eric Lopez, shares 10 tips he received from his commander that stood him in good stead. As I couldn’t have said it better myself, I’ve included the video.\n2) Mutual trust: lead by example\nIt’s clear that you’re more likely to delegate to those you trust. But it also goes the other way: if your team believes you trust them, they will be more willing to use their initiative and follow your lead. So how can you build trust during wartime?\nCol. Sharpe Jr. and Lt. Col. Creviston compiled some useful trust-building research here:\n- Reduce physical distance e.g. try to co-locate\n- Create positive personal interactions e.g. arrange a dinner\n- Acknowledge past accomplishments and reputation e.g. celebrate small wins regularly\n- Highlight common values e.g. write your values on the walls\nHowever, the biggest driver of trust and morale (known in the military as esprit de corps) is the actions leaders display. Sharpe and Creviston write:\n“Leaders of confidence, competence and high moral values exude esprit de corps and provide a contagious commitment to the organisation and its norms.”\n3) Shared understanding: meet regularly\nCreating a shared understanding of the situation, objectives, and each other’s roles is fundamental to Mission Command.\nWar room meetings may take place anywhere from from a couple of times a week to a couple of times a day, depending on how quickly the situation is changing. You’ll review metrics, share progress and learnings from the trenches, and coordinate as plans evolve.\nYou may use real-time dashboards, TV screens, posters and whiteboards to make important information visible, such as KPIs, recent developments and the commander’s intent.\n4) Commander’s intent: outline the unifying goal\nThe Commander’s Intent is a description of the purpose of the operation. It must include the wider context, the key objectives, and the desired end state.\nIt’s worth crafting it concisely and precisely since it will become a focal point for the operation and will be used to make decisions when you’re not present. If it’s more than a paragraph, it’s too long. You may even create a five-word mantra that sums it up.\nWhen the business is under threat, emotions can run high. Delivering the Commander’s Intent is your call to arms. Use a combination of vision and vulnerability to win hearts and minds:\n- Vulnerability: I don’t have all the answers, we’ll need to trust each other and give our all, and there’s only limited certainty I can offer.\n- Vision: If we give it everything we’ve got, not only are we in with a chance, but we won’t have any regrets. So here’s our intent…\n5) Mission orders: describe the results you want\nA mission order might sound prescriptive, but it actually focuses on the outcome, not the method.\n“Mission orders are directives that emphasise to subordinates the results to be attained, not how they are to achieve them” — Mission Command, ADP 6.0, Department of the Army\nUnlike micromanagement, mission orders rely on your team’s disciplined initiative. After giving orders, you need to check in with your team and provide additional direction and support as required.\n6) Disciplined initiative: exercise freedom and responsibility\nThe expectation set in the military that the team will use their initiative to deliver results that are (i) aligned to Commander’s Intent, and (ii) coordinated with the efforts of other team members.\nThe ‘W’ process provides clarity over the roles of leadership and teams in the planning process.\n- Step 1: Leadership sets the context (Commander’s Intent and Mission Orders)\n- Step 2: The team creates their plans (Disciplined Initiative)\n- Step 3: Leadership integrates their plans\n- Step 4: The team verbally commit\nUnder this process, the Commander is responsible for ensuring plans fit together. If the commander isn’t available, the team must proactively share their updates—progress, priorities and problems—between themselves.\n7) Risk acceptance: measure before you cut\nGiven the same amount of intelligence, timidity will do a thousand times more damage in war than audacity — Carl von Clausewitz\nTaking risks often brings with it great opportunities.However, risks must be analysed by you and your team to ensure the benefits outweigh the costs.\nIn my first startup, we wanted to boost sales to rescue a failing fundraising effort. My partner and I came up with an idea for a marketing stunt that could reach thousands of potential customers.\nThe stunt came with a big price tag—equivalent to the monthly cost of the business. The chances were slim, but we reasoned that if it worked, we’d have a better chance of convincing sceptical investors. So we ran with it.\nIt was a bet-the-house moment and it felt thrilling… until the campaign turned out to be a flop.\nLooking back, we didn’t properly estimate the risks, and we took an uninformed bet. If our existing investors hadn’t come out to rescue us, the company would have gone under. I learned a valuable lesson:\nNever gamble with your company.\nAnalysing risk and making intentional choices is playing the odds. For example, jumping on a plane to meet a high-potential investor is a risk, but it doesn’t put the entire company in jeopardy.\nRedefining success\nThe Commander’s Intent will spell out the desired end state. It’s tempting to define success as meeting that end state. However, I’d like to suggest a different definition: success is survival.\nEvery mission order completed is worth celebrating. Every hard-earned learning is worth celebrating. Every week that you survive is a success worth celebrating. Don’t forget to celebrate the small wins.\nNext up: knowing when to retreat\nRunning a War Room can help create the conditions for inspiring team spirit and collaboration. Small, empowered teams can generate incredible results.\nHowever, as CEO, it’s also your job to manage your resources. to ensure you can weather the storm. Decisions involving layoffs are among the hardest any leader has to take, so in the next part we’ll go through how best to approach this together. Until then, godspeed and good luck.\nOriginally published 4 Aug 2023\nHow do top founders actually scale?\nI’ve coached CEOs for 10,000+ hours—here’s what works.\nJoin 17,000+ founders learning how to scale with clarity.\nUnsubscribe any time.",

    "content": "A Simple Way to Make Leadership Team Meetings Easier\nWritten by Dave Bailey\nIf you’re trying to do too much, here’s a simple solution.\nWhat makes leadership team meetings trickier than they should be?\nThat’s a question I’ve been asking a lot of CEOs, both on my podcast and my coaching programs. Frequent answers include:\n- A lack of alignment over the objective of the meeting\n- A lack of clarity over people’s roles\n- A lack of trust between members\nHowever, even if these aren’t issues for you, some team meetings can still be difficult — and that’s down to how our brains work.\nCreative problem solving requires two very different cognitive processes: divergent and convergent thinking:\n- Divergent thinking is the process of coming up with new ideas and possibilities.\n- Convergent thinking is associated with analysis, judgement, and decision-making.\nAs the names suggest, these processes are complementary but oppose each other — and it’s hard to do both at the same time.\nThink about a brainstorming session. People are thinking creatively to solve a particular problem, and ideas are being shared — this is divergent thought. Now imagine that someone is immediately judging those ideas and saying, ‘nope, we tried that and it doesn’t work’. Can you see how that might limit new ideas from emerging?\nIn contrast, think about a morning standup meeting where people are sharing their plans for the day to resolve any blockers — this is convergent thought. Now imagine someone is suggesting new ideas and mentioning new opportunities. Can you see how that might be disruptive for someone who really needs to crack on?\nDifferent meetings need different cognitive modes, for example:\n- Standups need convergent thinking\n- Retrospectives need divergent thinking\n- One-on-ones need divergent thinking, followed by convergent thinking\n- Strategic planning need divergent thinking, followed by convergent thinking\nOn one hand, leadership team meetings can provide an opportunity to think creatively, voice new ideas, and investigate new possibilities. But on the other, they are a time to analyse progress, make decisions and align on a plan.\nOne reason why leadership team meetings underdeliver is they try to be divergent and convergent at the same time.\nSo here’s an alternative that you might experiment with. Once you’ve clarified the plan for the next cycle, try replacing your leadership meeting with separate meetings:\n- Update (convergent thinking): you can review OKRs, analyse performance, and agree on next steps. This might be weekly.\n- Retrospective (divergent thinking ending in convergence): you share what’s going well, what isn’t, and find an opportunity to improve. This might be bi-weekly.\n- Forum (divergent thinking ending in convergence): you discuss open leadership topics as a group and define any action items. This might be bi-weekly, rotating with retrospectives.\nIf you feel like you’re trying to do too much in your team meetings, maybe you are. Splitting out the convergent and divergent processes might help you to foster the right mindset, stay connected, and find the convergence you’re looking for.\nOriginally published Jul 30, 2021, updated Jun 2, 2023\nHow do top founders actually scale?\nI’ve coached CEOs for 10,000+ hours—here’s what works.\nJoin 17,000+ founders learning how to scale with clarity.\nUnsubscribe any time.",

    "content": "How to Design an Amazing Strategy Offsite\nWritten by Dave Bailey\nSuccessful strategy sessions tend to follow a common arc.\nMost leadership teams come together for at least a few days each year to meet up as a team, align on the business strategy, and collaborate on the company’s biggest challenges. These meetings are often held offsite, as physical distance from day-to-day operations can make it easier to see the bigger picture.\nThe pressure to deliver something tangible can make setting the agenda an intimidating task. There are many topics you could discuss and alignment can seem a long way away. How can you make the best use of your team’s problem-solving abilities and arrive at something concrete?\nI’ve created the following structure to help you design your agenda:\nLet’s run through each section.\nPart 1: Set up\nIt’s customary for the CEO to open the offsite with some inspiring words on the mission and vision of the company, and the purpose of the offsite. However, there are a couple of other activities that can ensure the offsite runs smoothly.\nFirstly, establishing ground rules on how to behave, known as ‘contracting’, can help you avoid unproductive behaviours such as interrupting, waffling, or losing focus (often with a mobile phone in hand). Here are three questions that will help the group design their own ground rules:\n- What behaviours must we commit to so we all get the most from this offsite?\n- Do we give each other permission to reinforce these commitments?\n- How should we reinforce them?\nInjecting some creativity into setting and reinforcing ground rules can be helpful. For example, one of my clients uses the term ‘devil’s avocado’ to inject a little humour and make people more relaxed about challenging the consensus.\nSecondly, presenting certain words and phrases can nudge the team into a more strategic mindset, known as ‘behavioural priming’. Here are some concepts that may help the team later on when they get into discussions:\n- Embrace the Paradox Mindset: many strategic decisions are nuanced. When faced with an impossible ‘either or’, reframe as ‘both and’ to draw out the nuance.\n- Choose clarity over certainty: waiting for certainty can lead to paralysis. If the data would take too long to collect, be ready to take bold decisions to move forward.\n- Work on the business, not in the business: it’s easy to get hung up on details, especially when they involve you. Try to focus on the big picture.\n- Silence means you disagree: we often interpret silence as passive agreement, when it’s actually the opposite. Investigating any silences can often surface contrary opinions that would otherwise remain unheard.\n- Perfect is the enemy of done: strategy development is an iterative process. Remind people to strive for good enough, not perfect.\n- Ego is the enemy: the right answer might not be your answer. Learn to let go of your ideas and listen to others.\nReflecting on how each of your cultural values can guide behaviours is another way to prime the team. And finally, remind the team that every leader is here for a reason, and all of their diverse perspectives and contributions are critical to the offsite’s success.\nPart 2: Connect\nFostering connection in the group at an early stage early in the offsite helps you increase the sense of trust and psychological safety needed for healthy conflict and debate. You might include lunches and dinner for help leaders to get to know each other, but building connections is so important that I’d recommend also dedicating some ‘work hours’ to it too.\nActivities that increase a sense of connection typically involve safe ways for the group to be vulnerable and share feelings and needs — and be heard. There are lots of team building ideas out there, but here are a few of my favourites:\n- ‘One-question ice-breakers’: Effective questions are ones that allow people to share something about themselves, such as ‘What past event are you most proud of?’, ‘What’s something funny we might not know about you?’ or ‘What’s a significant event that helped you grow as a person?’. Everyone could answer the same question, or pick one out of a hat.\n- ‘Diversity introductions’: Ask people to choose 2 or 3 different dimensions that impacted who they are today, and introduce themselves through those dimensions. These sessions can be very powerful.\n- ‘Round-robin retrospectives’: I’ve written about leadership retrospectives before. They are a really quick way for people to get things off their chest, and provide practical insights to the group.\n- ‘Emotional check-in’: Ask people to share how they are feeling about the offsite. For example, what are you excited about? What are you curious about? What are you nervous about?\nTo be clear, I’m not recommending you do all of these exercises — just that you make space for building connections before jumping into the workshops. It’s when people feel connected that real teamwork can begin.\nLearn new skills every week ->\nPart 3: Diverge\nOne of the most important ideas in creative problem solving (and hopefully there’s space for this in your offsite) is that divergent and convergent thinking are different cognitive modes:\n- Divergent thinking is the process of coming up with new ideas and possibilities.\n- Convergent thinking is associated with analysis, judgement, and decision-making.\nThese different modes are like oil and water — they don’t mix well. Instant judgement can make coming up with ideas feel unsafe, and coming up with new possibilities while planning can be equally unhelpful. So it’s best to separate the divergent and convergent topics distinctly and deliberately.\nDivergent topics might include things like:\n- Horizon scanning: looking at new possibilities and opportunities in a particular area of the business\n- Brainstorming: collecting as many ideas as possible on a particular business problem\n- Open discussions: discussing controversial or paradoxical questions that have no right answer\nPresenting content can help share relative context with the team, but long presentations tend to suck the oxygen out of the room. That’s why good workshops mix up formats every 10–20 minutes to manage energy levels and increase engagement from the group. Here are some formats that can form the building blocks of workshops.\n- Presentations: keep slides short, punchy and visual (tends to reduce energy in the room)\n- Group discussions: for large teams, split into small groups to discuss (tends to increase energy in the room)\n- Exercises and activities: make the steps as simple as possible (tends to increase energy in the room)\n- Q&A: send out-of-scope questions to the 'parking lot' (tends to reduce energy in the room)\nYou can find more information about workshop design here.\nFor some people, divergent workshops that surface new ideas and open possibilities are exhilarating. However, for others, these conversations can be unsatisfying or even anxiety-inducing — particularly if their role involves operations. You can reassure your team that convergence is coming… just not yet.\nPart 4: Converge\nDivergent workshops surface new ideas and questions, while convergent workshops are designed to analyse and prioritise those ideas, and to make decisions.\nIt’s really worth having an extended break — a long lunch or ideally a night’s sleep — to separate the divergent and convergent sessions. This allows the dust to settle and helps people switch from a creative mindset to an analytical one.\nConvergent topics might include:\n- Analysis: assessing pros and cons, prioritising ideas, estimating effort (perhaps by using planning poker)\n- Decision-making: empowering leaders to make decisions and build consensus\n- Planning: taking decisions and forming action plans\nIt’s helpful to clarify the format of the output of each session ahead of time. For example, if you use OKRs, a table that allows people to clarify their objectives, key results and initiatives can help people stay on track.\nIn the convergent phase, an empowered CEO has a special role to play: to ensure the leaders’ outputs are aligned to each other — and to the strategy as a whole. This typically involves noticing any logical inconsistencies and coaching the team to figure out their differences. And in the case of a deadlock, the CEO’s decision goes.\nIf you’re a CEO looking to level up on strategy and communication, this coaching program may be of interest.\nLearn new skills every week ->\nPart 5: Commit\nAt this point, you’ve come together as a group, come up with new ideas, and made some important decisions. Now it’s time to lock it in, and make commitments as a group.\n‘Disagree and commit’ has become a popular expression used by startup leaders — and it’s helpful to discuss it as a team at this stage. You can ask the team explicitly:\nWhat does disagree and commit mean for us here?\nOften, leaders will come to an agreement with the leadership team at the time, only to say to their team later: “this wasn’t my idea”. To me, ‘disagree and commit’ means getting behind ideas you may not agree with, helping them succeed, and bringing your team with you.\nFor this reason, it’s good practice to go round the room and get verbal sign-off on key decisions from every leader. Remember, silence means you disagree.\nIf there are any follow-up items or action points coming out of the offsite, these can be assigned at this point as well.\nPart 6: Celebrate\nA great way to end the offsite is by returning to the mission and vision you outlined in the introduction. Thank the team for their efforts and contributions, and congratulate them on a job well done. The more you tell your team they are capable of great things, the more they’ll believe it.\nAs a startup leader, you want to take every opportunity to celebrate the small wins — and aligning on a strategy and path forward is a big deal. When it comes to celebrations, a bit of planning goes a long way, so don’t make this an afterthought.\nHow to Prepare\nIt’ll be obvious by now that crafting a successful offsite takes preparation. While the CEO typically owns the high-level agenda, they’ll need to share the preparation work with their leaders. For example:\n- Gathering data and preparing analysis\n- Researching trends and learnings\n- Running SWOT analysis in their area\n- Supporting on workshop design and output templates\n- Collecting customer stories\nCustomer stories are some of the most valuable resources you can bring to offsites. When each leader (i.e. sales, marketing, product) brings their own customer stories, it can make strategic issues come alive, and increase a sense of purpose. Your customers can’t be there, but their stories can.\nMake It Your Own\nI’m always amazed by the creativity my clients bring to their offsites. Amazing locations, exciting exercises and even special guests can bring a sense of ‘wow’ to the event. But when they reflect on the day, it was the sense of connection and the ability to converge on something concrete that stands out as most important.\nI hope this structure helps you design a better offsite.

    "content": "A Manager’s Guide to Holding Your Team Accountable\nWritten by Dave Bailey\nIf you struggle with holding people to account, try this.\nBeing held to account for our decisions, actions, and results can drive high performance. It helps clarifies our commitments, increases our diligence, and improves our self-awareness.\nMost of us report to someone. For CEOs, it’s a board of directors. For others, it’s their manager or their coach. But despite all our reporting structures, real accountability is elusive for many teams.\nWhy Accountability Slips\nThe main reason accountability isn’t held is because holding people to account feels confrontational for both the report and the manager.\nFor the report, answering a barrage of questions can feel like an inquisition. Top performers often spend time predicting potential questions and preparing answers in advance, just to soothe this discomfort. If you do this, you’re actually holding yourself accountable—great work.\nBut it can be anxiety-inducing for managers too. The role involves the following:\n- Asking probing questions about what happened\n- Clarify their report’s explicit and implicit commitments\n- Deliver feedback clearly and constructively\nWhen the report struggles to answer a hard question, empathic founders feel the discomfort too. However, a lot of stress comes from a desire to give feedback, and a lot of it. Often, it’s feedback the manager has been sitting on for a while. It’s easy to see mistakes and patterns from a distance, and when feedback builds up, it can be hard to know where to start or how to deliver it.\nAccountability slips when managers fail to remind the team of their commitments, ask probing questions about past actions, and deliver constructive feedback. And performance slips with it.\nLearn new skills every week ->\nTeams Need Both Accountability And Feedback\nIf you want to be effective at holding people accountable, you also have to be good at providing feedback too. A helpful starting point is to acknowledge accountability and feedback are different processes:\n- Holding someone to account: asking probing questions about past actions, decisions and events\n- Giving someone feedback: providing your reaction to past actions, decisions and events\nTo help you drive more accountability in your company—and give more feedback—here’s a quick primer on both.\n1) Holding Someone to Account\nHolding someone to account means asking probing questions, such as:\n- What were you trying to achieve?\n- What was your plan?\n- What options did you consider?\n- What drove your decision?\n- What actually happened?\n- How did you react?\n- When did this happen?\n- What did you learn?\n- What would you do differently?\nThese are the same questions boards ask CEOs. They feel exposing because that’s their purpose: to expose someone’s thought process — often revealing mistakes (we all make them!).\nThese questions increase a person’s awareness (including self-awareness) which in turn can generate insights that lead to professional growth.\nFor accountability to take place, the report needs to hold a commitment, either explicitly i.e. an agreed action item, or implicitly, as part of their role. If their commitment isn’t clear, accountability falls apart.\n“You never specified the report was due by today.”\n“Yes, but I was expecting you to read my mind.”\nI say this somewhat jokingly, but every manager knows the feeling when they realise a commitment they thought was crystal clear wasn’t as clear as they hoped.\nUnclear commitments often stem from unclear roles. Startups often have a more fluid organisation structure since they want people to wear several hats. They rely on high conscientiousness to ensure commitments are held. Over time, startups drive more accountability by clarifying roles, often incrementally after a ball is dropped.\nFor true accountability to take place, it helps to set up an ‘accountability loop’ with the following three questions:\n- What will you do? (the committed action)\n- When will you do it? (the timeframe)\n- How will I know? (the reporting method)\nAnd there’s one question that gives you the answer to all three at once: What concrete action can you commit to completing before our next meeting?\nFollowing up on action items is the bread-and-butter of accountability. It’s not sexy but just like doing household chores, it’s necessary to make sure everyone plays their part in keeping the house tidy. “Did you take out the garbage?”\nHowever, there will be times when an action item or commitment isn’t completed. In these cases, ask additional questions such as:\n- What stopped you from following through?\n- Was this the right action? Is this still important?\n- What’s the real challenge here for you?\n- How will you ensure you follow through next time?\nMaking commitments and following up on them makes it easy to see whether an executive is keeping their commitments or falling short. If commitments routinely aren’t kept, or if their answers reveal a lack of diligence or competence, then managers must hold themselves accountable for their job: to get the right people in the right roles.\nLearn new skills every week ->\n2) Giving Someone Feedback\nAs I wrote in ‘The Best Way to Develop Your Team Isn’t Feedback’, feedback refers to someone’s reaction to something. Asking questions isn’t technically feedback — and therefore, feedback is not holding someone to account.\nSome feedback is more useful than others. Feedback you want to avoid are generalised statements, such as:\n- ‘You are lazy’ (a character attack)\n- ‘You’re always late’ (a generalisation)\n- ‘You’re ignoring me’ (implied intent)\nConstructive feedback is far more specific. The act of turning vague feedback into something more concrete is valuable for both sides. A useful model of feedback is the SBI model:\n- Situation—when specifically are you referring to?\n- Behaviour—what did you observe? (i.e. direct quotes, visible behaviours)\n- Impact—what was the effect on you and/or the team?\nSecretly, many of us are worried that our feedback will be taken personally or interpreted as micro-management, so we avoid giving it. But sitting on feedback can generate resentment and contempt which put significant stress on any relationship.\nFor feedback to be constructive, it helps if the following three conditions are met:\n- The feedback is specific\n- The feedback is de-personalised\n- The person receiving it is open to hearing it\nOne way to help set up the conditions for honest feedback is simply to ask permission to give it:\n“Do I have permission to give you some specific feedback on [topic]?”\nJust clarifying the non-personal topic of the feedback can help take the conversation to a more productive place.`\nYou might be thinking, ‘do I need to ask permission every time?’ Of course, you don’t need to ask every time. That said, while your position often comes with the implicit expectation that you’ll give feedback, I’ve found that asking for permission can be a helpful way to start a feedback conversation. If it helps, use it, if not, don’t.\nTransitioning to Accountability/Feedback\nMany managers resist these uncomfortable conversations because they don’t know how to start them. Here are a few ways to begin an accountability or feedback conversation.\n- I noticed [concrete observation]. Is everything ok?\n- I noticed [concrete observation] happened a few times now. What’s the pattern here?\n- [non-personal topic] has been on my mind. Could we have a quick chat to figure it out?\n- May we spend a bit of time going through your progress on [initiative]?\n- Do you have a few minutes to dive into [initiative] with me?\nQuestions can be a helpful starting point because they allow the person to share information that you might not have. Of course, for more serious issues, you may ditch the questions and cut straight to the chase.\nLearn new skills every week ->\nIsn’t This Just Coaching?\nCoaching is the art of maximising someone’s personal and/or professional growth. Holding someone to account and providing feedback are both part of the coaching toolkit, but there are many other ways to coach.\nIn particular, questions that help clarify a person’s goals and values can often be more powerful than asking probing questions about past actions and even giving feedback.\nI’ve written a detailed overview of the coaching process, but I’ll stick to accountability and feedback in this essay.\nWhat If You’re Being Held to Account?\nThere’s no getting around it: being held to account and receiving feedback is challenging for all of us. Even though the job of your manager is to ask questions, challenge your decisions, and provide another point of view, it can still trigger disabling internal narratives such as:\n- “They don’t think I’m good enough”\n- “They don’t trust me to look after the details”\n- “I’m a complete failure”\nThese narratives can lead to fear, shame and panic… all of which take you out of your comfort zone.\nHowever, discomfort can lead to growth — if you have the right mindset. Try not to take it personally, and instead look for professional insights that can help you improve both the outcomes of your work, and the perception others have of you.\nNormalising Accountability & Feedback\nAccountability and feedback are essential to high-functioning teams. A helpful starting point is to normalise the following questions:\n- “What concrete action can you commit to completing before our next meeting?”\n- “Shall we follow up on the actions from last time?”\n- “Do I have permission to give you some specific feedback on [topic]?”\nWhen teams are ready to make commitments, receive probing questions, and take constructive feedback on board, without taking it personally, they will find so many opportunities to drive awareness, clarity and professional growth. And that’s where performance begins.\nFor further reading:\n- How to Create a Feedback Culture\n- Here’s a Simple Way to Hold Your Team Accountable\n- The Best Way to Develop Your Team Isn’t Feedback\nOriginally published Jun 30, 2021, updated Jul 7, 2023\nHow do top founders actually scale?\nI’ve coached CEOs for 10,000+ hours—here’s what works.\nJoin 17,000+ founders learning how to scale with clarity.\nUnsubscribe any time.",

    "content": "A Simple Way to Make Leadership Team Meetings Easier\nWritten by Dave Bailey\nIf you’re trying to do too much, here’s a simple solution.\nWhat makes leadership team meetings trickier than they should be?\nThat’s a question I’ve been asking a lot of CEOs, both on my podcast and my coaching programs. Frequent answers include:\n- A lack of alignment over the objective of the meeting\n- A lack of clarity over people’s roles\n- A lack of trust between members\nHowever, even if these aren’t issues for you, some team meetings can still be difficult — and that’s down to how our brains work.\nCreative problem solving requires two very different cognitive processes: divergent and convergent thinking:\n- Divergent thinking is the process of coming up with new ideas and possibilities.\n- Convergent thinking is associated with analysis, judgement, and decision-making.\nAs the names suggest, these processes are complementary but oppose each other — and it’s hard to do both at the same time.\nThink about a brainstorming session. People are thinking creatively to solve a particular problem, and ideas are being shared — this is divergent thought. Now imagine that someone is immediately judging those ideas and saying, ‘nope, we tried that and it doesn’t work’. Can you see how that might limit new ideas from emerging?\nIn contrast, think about a morning standup meeting where people are sharing their plans for the day to resolve any blockers — this is convergent thought. Now imagine someone is suggesting new ideas and mentioning new opportunities. Can you see how that might be disruptive for someone who really needs to crack on?\nDifferent meetings need different cognitive modes, for example:\n- Standups need convergent thinking\n- Retrospectives need divergent thinking\n- One-on-ones need divergent thinking, followed by convergent thinking\n- Strategic planning need divergent thinking, followed by convergent thinking\nOn one hand, leadership team meetings can provide an opportunity to think creatively, voice new ideas, and investigate new possibilities. But on the other, they are a time to analyse progress, make decisions and align on a plan.\nOne reason why leadership team meetings underdeliver is they try to be divergent and convergent at the same time.\nSo here’s an alternative that you might experiment with. Once you’ve clarified the plan for the next cycle, try replacing your leadership meeting with separate meetings:\n- Update (convergent thinking): you can review OKRs, analyse performance, and agree on next steps.

    "content": "How to Design an Amazing Strategy Offsite\nWritten by Dave Bailey\nSuccessful strategy sessions tend to follow a common arc.\nMost leadership teams come together for at least a few days each year to meet up as a team, align on the business strategy, and collaborate on the company’s biggest challenges. These meetings are often held offsite, as physical distance from day-to-day operations can make it easier to see the bigger picture.\nThe pressure to deliver something tangible can make setting the agenda an intimidating task. There are many topics you could discuss and alignment can seem a long way away. How can you make the best use of your team’s problem-solving abilities and arrive at something concrete?\nI’ve created the following structure to help you design your agenda:\nLet’s run through each section.\nPart 1: Set up\nIt’s customary for the CEO to open the offsite with some inspiring words on the mission and vision of the company, and the purpose of the offsite. However, there are a couple of other activities that can ensure the offsite runs smoothly.\nFirstly, establishing ground rules on how to behave, known as ‘contracting’, can help you avoid unproductive behaviours such as interrupting, waffling, or losing focus (often with a mobile phone in hand). Here are three questions that will help the group design their own ground rules:\n- What behaviours must we commit to so we all get the most from this offsite?\n- Do we give each other permission to reinforce these commitments?\n- How should we reinforce them?\nInjecting some creativity into setting and reinforcing ground rules can be helpful. For example, one of my clients uses the term ‘devil’s avocado’ to inject a little humour and make people more relaxed about challenging the consensus.\nSecondly, presenting certain words and phrases can nudge the team into a more strategic mindset, known as ‘behavioural priming’. Here are some concepts that may help the team later on when they get into discussions:\n- Embrace the Paradox Mindset: many strategic decisions are nuanced. When faced with an impossible ‘either or’, reframe as ‘both and’ to draw out the nuance.\n- Choose clarity over certainty: waiting for certainty can lead to paralysis. If the data would take too long to collect, be ready to take bold decisions to move forward.\n- Work on the business, not in the business: it’s easy to get hung up on details, especially when they involve you. Try to focus on the big picture.\n- Silence means you disagree: we often interpret silence as passive agreement, when it’s actually the opposite. Investigating any silences can often surface contrary opinions that would otherwise remain unheard.\n- Perfect is the enemy of done: strategy development is an iterative process. Remind people to strive for good enough, not perfect.\n- Ego is the enemy: the right answer might not be your answer. Learn to let go of your ideas and listen to others.\nReflecting on how each of your cultural values can guide behaviours is another way to prime the team. And finally, remind the team that every leader is here for a reason, and all of their diverse perspectives and contributions are critical to the offsite’s success.\nPart 2: Connect\nFostering connection in the group at an early stage early in the offsite helps you increase the sense of trust and psychological safety needed for healthy conflict and debate. You might include lunches and dinner for help leaders to get to know each other, but building connections is so important that I’d recommend also dedicating some ‘work hours’ to it too.\nActivities that increase a sense of connection typically involve safe ways for the group to be vulnerable and share feelings and needs — and be heard. There are lots of team building ideas out there, but here are a few of my favourites:\n- ‘One-question ice-breakers’: Effective questions are ones that allow people to share something about themselves, such as ‘What past event are you most proud of?’, ‘What’s something funny we might not know about you?’ or ‘What’s a significant event that helped you grow as a person?’. Everyone could answer the same question, or pick one out of a hat.\n- ‘Diversity introductions’: Ask people to choose 2 or 3 different dimensions that impacted who they are today, and introduce themselves through those dimensions. These sessions can be very powerful.\n- ‘Round-robin retrospectives’: I’ve written about leadership retrospectives before. They are a really quick way for people to get things off their chest, and provide practical insights to the group.\n- ‘Emotional check-in’: Ask people to share how they are feeling about the offsite. For example, what are you excited about? What are you curious about? What are you nervous about?\nTo be clear, I’m not recommending you do all of these exercises — just that you make space for building connections before jumping into the workshops. It’s when people feel connected that real teamwork can begin.\nLearn new skills every week ->\nPart 3: Diverge\nOne of the most important ideas in creative problem solving (and hopefully there’s space for this in your offsite) is that divergent and convergent thinking are different cognitive modes:\n- Divergent thinking is the process of coming up with new ideas and possibilities.\n- Convergent thinking is associated with analysis, judgement, and decision-making.\nThese different modes are like oil and water — they don’t mix well. Instant judgement can make coming up with ideas feel unsafe, and coming up with new possibilities while planning can be equally unhelpful. So it’s best to separate the divergent and convergent topics distinctly and deliberately.\nDivergent topics might include things like:\n- Horizon scanning: looking at new possibilities and opportunities in a particular area of the business\n- Brainstorming: collecting as many ideas as possible on a particular business problem\n- Open discussions: discussing controversial or paradoxical questions that have no right answer\nPresenting content can help share relative context with the team, but long presentations tend to suck the oxygen out of the room. That’s why good workshops mix up formats every 10–20 minutes to manage energy levels and increase engagement from the group. Here are some formats that can form the building blocks of workshops.\n- Presentations: keep slides short, punchy and visual (tends to reduce energy in the room)\n- Group discussions: for large teams, split into small groups to discuss (tends to increase energy in the room)\n- Exercises and activities: make the steps as simple as possible (tends to increase energy in the room)\n- Q&A: send out-of-scope questions to the 'parking lot' (tends to reduce energy in the room)\nYou can find more information about workshop design here.\nFor some people, divergent workshops that surface new ideas and open possibilities are exhilarating. However, for others, these conversations can be unsatisfying or even anxiety-inducing — particularly if their role involves operations. You can reassure your team that convergence is coming… just not yet.\nPart 4: Converge\nDivergent workshops surface new ideas and questions, while convergent workshops are designed to analyse and prioritise those ideas, and to make decisions.\nIt’s really worth having an extended break — a long lunch or ideally a night’s sleep — to separate the divergent and convergent sessions. This allows the dust to settle and helps people switch from a creative mindset to an analytical one.\nConvergent topics might include:\n- Analysis: assessing pros and cons, prioritising ideas, estimating effort (perhaps by using planning poker)\n- Decision-making: empowering leaders to make decisions and build consensus\n- Planning: taking decisions and forming action plans\nIt’s helpful to clarify the format of the output of each session ahead of time. For example, if you use OKRs, a table that allows people to clarify their objectives, key results and initiatives can help people stay on track.\nIn the convergent phase, an empowered CEO has a special role to play: to ensure the leaders’ outputs are aligned to each other — and to the strategy as a whole. This typically involves noticing any logical inconsistencies and coaching the team to figure out their differences. And in the case of a deadlock, the CEO’s decision goes.\nIf you’re a CEO looking to level up on strategy and communication, this coaching program may be of interest.\nLearn new skills every week ->\nPart 5: Commit\nAt this point, you’ve come together as a group, come up with new ideas, and made some important decisions. Now it’s time to lock it in, and make commitments as a group.\n‘Disagree and commit’ has become a popular expression used by startup leaders — and it’s helpful to discuss it as a team at this stage. You can ask the team explicitly:\nWhat does disagree and commit mean for us here?\nOften, leaders will come to an agreement with the leadership team at the time, only to say to their team later: “this wasn’t my idea”. To me, ‘disagree and commit’ means getting behind ideas you may not agree with, helping them succeed, and bringing your team with you.\nFor this reason, it’s good practice to go round the room and get verbal sign-off on key decisions from every leader. Remember, silence means you disagree.\nIf there are any follow-up items or action points coming out of the offsite, these can be assigned at this point as well.\nPart 6: Celebrate\nA great way to end the offsite is by returning to the mission and vision you outlined in the introduction. Thank the team for their efforts and contributions, and congratulate them on a job well done. The more you tell your team they are capable of great things, the more they’ll believe it.\nAs a startup leader, you want to take every opportunity to celebrate the small wins — and aligning on a strategy and path forward is a big deal. When it comes to celebrations, a bit of planning goes a long way, so don’t make this an afterthought.\nHow to Prepare\nIt’ll be obvious by now that crafting a successful offsite takes preparation. While the CEO typically owns the high-level agenda, they’ll need to share the preparation work with their leaders. For example:\n- Gathering data and preparing analysis\n- Researching trends and learnings\n- Running SWOT analysis in their area\n- Supporting on workshop design and output templates\n- Collecting customer stories\nCustomer stories are some of the most valuable resources you can bring to offsites. When each leader (i.e. sales, marketing, product) brings their own customer stories, it can make strategic issues come alive, and increase a sense of purpose. Your customers can’t be there, but their stories can.\nMake It Your Own\nI’m always amazed by the creativity my clients bring to their offsites. Amazing locations, exciting exercises and even special guests can bring a sense of ‘wow’ to the event. But when they reflect on the day, it was the sense of connection and the ability to converge on something concrete that stands out as most important.\nI hope this structure helps you design a better offsite.

    "content": "The Neuroscience of Procrastination, Habits, and the Flow State\nEveryday our minds are bombarded with a swirl of information, visual, and auditory stimuli. It can be difficult to concentrate on the tasks at hand, whether it’s your work at the office or your latest creative project. But there are good habits you can build up that help you concentrate with ease, and even enter that desirable mode known as “the flow state,” in which you feel entirely immersed in whatever you may be doing in the present moment, beyond the point of distraction.\nToday we’d like to examine the brain’s chemical processes to understand why we procrastinate, become distracted, and lose focus. We’ll also explore the neuroscience of what happens when we’re able to break unhealthy habits, build healthy ones, and find freedom in the flow state.\nProcrastination and the Brain\nProcrastination is the action of delaying or postponing something despite knowing the negative consequences. It’s a common barrier to concentration, but it’s more than incompetence or laziness. In fact, it’s biologically rooted in an eternal battle taking place in our brain between the limbic system and the prefrontal cortex.\nThe limbic system is also known as the paleomammalian brain because it’s one of the oldest mental systems. One of the most important aspects is the amygdala, which dominates many of our behavioral and emotional responses. However, its processes often occur involuntarily and governs pleasure seeking, instant gratification, and the survival response, so if you feel your fight-or-flight instinct, that’s your limbic system activating.\nYour limbic system is linked in a struggle with the prefrontal cortex, which is a newer and less developed part of the brain. Here, the brain makes logical analyses, plans for the future, and expresses your personality. It also governs self-control.\nDue to the strength of the limbic system, it often dominates the prefrontal cortex, leading to procrastination. The brain craves dopamine, a feel-good chemical that results from doing or seeing something that feels good in the moment, and therefore when trying to decide between watching Netflix or doing laundry, it’s far easier to grant your brain the dopamine reward of watching a fun show.\nStrategies for Overcoming Procrastination\nOvercoming procrastination doesn’t have to be difficult. In fact, the brain will still release dopamine once you finish a task, and it’s important to allow yourself to relish that moment. Creating a list of your goals, introducing time management techniques, and setting mindfulness practices can be incredibly effective.\nFirst, write out a list of everything you need and would like to get done. Consider the priority of each task, and the time it will take to complete it. Is there a way you can break up a large task into smaller, doable chunks? So instead of seeing your writing assignment as one giant task, consider that you can create smaller goals like gathering sources, building an outline, beginning a first draft, finishing that draft, then doing a round of edits. You may find your goals easier to achieve, especially if you break up a large task over a few days.\nSpeaking of time management techniques, it may be helpful to give yourself timed breaks that make it easier to maintain your productive inertia. This could look like making yourself a smoothie after 45 minutes of work, no matter where you are in your task, so you can still grant yourself a dopamine reward.\nLastly, mindfulness practices can strengthen self-regulation. Meditation, for example, has been demonstrated to thicken the prefrontal cortex through gyrification, the creation of more folds, which increases the ability to process, think, and self-inhibit. The prefrontal cortex increases its projection to the amygdala to down regulate its activity, so you’re less likely to follow your impulses. Other mindfulness practices that may help self-regulation include being present on a walk, doing exercise, cooking a meal, knitting, or journaling.\nBuilding Habits and the Brain\nHabits are regularly repeated behaviors that tend to occur subconsciously. However, to regain control of a habit, it may be helpful to reframe them as a neural pathway in the brain. Neural pathways are composed of neurons that are connected by dendrites. The more times you perform a behavior, the more dendrites are created to strengthen that connection.\nAccording to Psychologist Deann Ware, Ph.D, brain cells communicate with each other through “neuronal firing,” and when we continually perform a habit, these messages transmit faster, which eventually help these habits become automatic due to a well-traveled neural pathway. However, as we participate in new activities, we can train the brain to form new neural pathways.\nHabit Loops\nRepetition is key to form a habit, and it may be helpful to tap into all five senses that help a habit stick. This can look like visualizing a goal and connecting it to all five senses; what would it look or feel like to master playing the guitar? Or do a handstand? This may help the most difficult aspect of achieving a task: starting it.\nYou can create a habit loop that consists of a cue, routine, and reward. In order to trigger a habit, there must be a cue, a strong response to external stimuli. For example, upon hearing the bell ring in school, you got up and moved to your next class. When you begin to perform an action in response to various cues, you form a routine. After work each day, your routine may be to call a friend on the drive home. Finally, the reward of dopamine encourages you to repeat that behavior from positive reinforcement that strengthens a neural pathway.\nUnfortunately, this is just as likely to lead to the creation of bad habits as much as good ones. When we don’t want to begin a project, we can get our dopamine hit from watching funny videos. The brain doesn’t differentiate whether it’s “good” or “bad;” it only stores that signal. The purpose is to decrease stress by creating healthy routines, but when our emotions fall out of balance, we can fall into detrimental cycles.\nGradually Changing Your Habits\nIt’s time to create some new neural pathways. If you have bad habits you’d like to break, write them down, and consider one or two you’d like to change. Try to identify the cause of that habit; perhaps stress leads you to doom scroll on social media, or boredom causes you to snack more than you’d like. If possible, remove the cause. For example, you can replace tempting prepackaged snacks with raw produce that can only be used when it’s time to cook.\nJust because you’ve removed a source doesn’t mean a feeling of stress or boredom disappears. Now you have the opportunity to ease those feelings with a positive habit. Instead of reaching for your phone when stressed, you can engage in a vigorous workout to release pent-up feelings. You can place your phone in another room to remove that distraction until the workout is complete. It’s common to slip up and fall back into a bad habit, but using compassionate self-talk can encourage you to try the new habit again.\nIt can help to reward yourself for engaging in good habits. By creating a habit tracker, you can see the result of your progress by checking off every daily habit and motivating yourself to keep up your progress. The key is creating a list of easily achievable habits that can be completed in under two minutes. Instead of aiming for an hour of exercise, challenge yourself to complete one minute, or even one push up! By repeating these small habits frequently, those new neural pathways will have you making your bed without thinking about it.\nFlow State and the Brain\nThe “flow state,” a term coined by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, is the mental state in which a person is entirely focused on a single activity, and not thinking about themselves nor their performance. Oftentimes, dancers, chess players, musicians, and artists can enter a flow state, but anyone is capable of entering a flow state while doing what they feel passionately about, from gardening to writing.\nDuring a flow state, many changes happen in the brain. Dopamine once again plays a starring role, and people in a state of flow have higher levels of dopamine, which also suppresses bodily sensations such as hunger and tiredness. It’s unclear whether activating the dopamine system enables flow, or the other way around; it’s likely they create a cycle.\nResearchers propose two theories for flow’s effects on the brain. The transient hypofrontality hypothesis suggests lower activity in the prefrontal cortex, and our executive function momentarily declines, which prevents self-conscious behavior. On the other hand, the synchronization theory of flow proposes that communication improves between different regions of the brain. Because a person usually has better control and coordination, it suggests higher levels of activity in the frontal cortex and therefore higher executive functioning.\nHow to Enter and Sustain the Flow State\nEntering the flow state can sometimes occur unintentionally, but there are few strategies to induce it. It’s best to set aside a large chunk of time, set your goals for the sessions, create an optimal environment for concentration, and engage in deep work techniques that may lead you there.\nDistractions can make it more difficult to enter a flow state, whether you’re distracted by social media or your email. Minimizing interruptions is easy with tools like Freedom, which blocks apps from functioning or sending notifications to your phone or computer for a set period of time. By creating customized sessions that allow you to choose which apps and sites are blocked for as much time as you’d like, you can focus on work tasks, creative projects, and everything else in between.\nDeep work is another term for a state of distraction-free concentration in which the brain operates optimally. It was coined by computer science professor Cal Newport, who wrote the book “Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World.” The theory suggests that to be truly productive, we must work uninterrupted without distractions for long periods of time each day. You could begin with an hour or two and work your way up. There are four philosophies that dictate deep work.\n- Rhythmic philosophy: This method sets 1-4 hours aside at the same time each day for deep focus. Consistency is key to this strategy, so it’s important to try to stick to your schedule. Time blocking is another management technique that may effectively complement this philosophy.\n- Journalistic philosophy: This is the most flexible approach, allowing you to fit deep work wherever you can in an ever-changing schedule. If you have at least 90 minutes between meetings, for instance, you could schedule time for deep work.\n- Monastic philosophy: This is the most intense method of deep work, and encourages you to spend all your work hours on a high level of focus. This has the potential to eliminate all shallow work and reject all distractions that arise.\n- Bimodal philosophy: You’ll be able to divide your time with long stretches of time, such as a full day, that is set aside for deep work, while the rest of your time can be set for shallow work. This is considered a more flexible version of the monastic philosophy, and allows you to spend a day or a week working deeply and then return to other obligations.\nIt may be best to experiment with the different philosophies before settling on a method that works for you. Mindfulness practices also help in improving the flow state, according to a study that found athletes improved their performance after mindfulness techniques.\nOvercome Procrastination to Improve Concentration\nThe next time you feel the procrastination calling your name, remember your limbic system is trying to convince you to find that easy dopamine rush. Allow your prefrontal cortex to take the front seat, and understand that the satisfaction of achieving your goals will result in a more satisfying rush. With the help of mindfulness techniques that strengthen your prefrontal cortex and the ability to organize your tasks into doable chunks, you’ll still be able to reap the dopamine benefits at will.\nThe creation of good habits will form new neural pathways in the brain that make it easier to engage in desired behaviors over time. By forming good habits around work and creative projects, you may find it easier to submerge yourself in deep work that can help you enter and sustain a flow state, where your concentration is deeply focused and your dopamine levels remain high.\nOftentimes the best thing we can do is eliminate distractions that keep us from building good habits and entering that flow state. With the help of tools like Freedom, you’ll find it easier than ever to literally block your distractions and find your own workflow.\nWritten by author Lorena Bally",

    "content": "What Founders Can Learn from Outbound Sales Teams\nWritten by Dave Bailey\nThe operational tactics that fuel repeatable sales processes have many applications for founders.\nSelling the dream is a key part of a founder’s job, whether that means convincing investors to invest, prospects to buy, or candidates to join the company. Existing relationships can be a big advantage, but when you’re just starting up, outbound prospecting is crucial in expanding your network and building new relationships.\nThe most common approach to prospecting is intuitive: reach out, see what happens, and repeat. You soon learn it’s a numbers game: speak to enough people and you’ll occasionally strike it lucky and close a deal — whether with a new investor, recruit, or customer.\nBut how can you increase those odds of striking it lucky?\nLearning from sales teams\nFor sales teams, prospecting and closing are full-time activities. Modern, at-scale teams have outgrown the intuitive approach and engineered processes that are more likely to turn leads into sales.\nOf course, not all sales leads are created equal and for our purposes here, we can put them in one of three categories:\n- Inbound leads — driven by ‘marketing’ activity (ads, content, events, etc.)\n- Outbound leads — driven by sales (cold emails, phone calls, etc.)\n- Referred leads — driven by customers (existing customers, prospects, partners, etc.)\nInbound and referred leads have higher conversion rates but tend to be less predictable than outbound leads. On the other hand, if you’re disciplined about reaching out to potential customers who are theoretically a good fit on paper you can begin to predict sales based on conversion rates. Effective outbound sales pipelines can achieve conversion rates of 20–40%.\nMany of the concepts used by prospecting teams have applications beyond sales, for example, in recruiting, marketing, and fundraising. Here are six of these concepts every founder should understand:\n- Structuring pipelines\n- Creating leads lists\n- Framing conversations\n- Building message sequences\n- Managing your time\n- Generating referrals\n1. Structuring pipelines\nIn 2011, Marylou Tyler wrote a book called Predictable Revenue, known by many as ‘The Sales Bible of Silicon Valley’. Marylou describes four stages in a typical sales development pipeline:\n- Cold — people who haven’t yet engaged with your business and you can reach out to\n- Working — people you’re actively talking with\n- Qualify — people who are actively deciding whether there’s a fit\n- Sales qualified leads (SQL) — people who are a fit and want to work with you\nShe also describes two further buckets for those who aren’t a fit:\n- Long-term follow-up — people who aren’t a fit yet, but may be in the future\n- Do not contact — people who aren’t a fit\nKey stages of a sales development pipeline, from Predictable Revenue.\nA pipeline doesn’t just organise the status of leads, it also prescribes the next step of the process — typically, a response or a follow-up. Following up is often neglected, either for fear of ‘being too pushy’ or due to disorganised, inefficient processes. However, a well-written follow-up is often makes the difference between success and failure.\nCRMs such as Pipedrive can also help, by flagging leads that don’t have a predetermined next step, so they don’t fall through the cracks.\n2. Creating leads lists\nWhen you have a pipeline, you need to fill it with leads, whether they’re investors, candidates, or companies. The first step is to identify your ideal customer profile (ICP) — a description of the ideal characteristics associated with the people or businesses you want to sell to. While you might have to start by making some smart assumptions, you’ll quickly learn which profiles actually respond, convert, and succeed, enabling you to update your ICP accordingly.\nThe more clearly you can articulate your ideal customer, the more likely it is that you’ll find them.\nBut finding them requires research. There are lots of places you might look, depending on what you’re selling. For example:\n- Customers: LinkedIn, AngelList, directories, existing databases, your network\n- Recruits: LinkedIn, your network, your existing employees\n- Investors: Investor databases, founders in your network\nAside from decision-makers, you might also reach out to indirect and direct influencers, who can help you gather company-specific information or internal referrals and practice your narrative. Here’s an example of an influencer mapping for the General Partner of a VC fund.\nIt’s unrealistic to think that all cold leads will convert straight away — particularly since timing is such an important component of every deal. Indeed, if you have this mindset, you’re likely to be seriously demotivated by the first ‘no’. Instead, consider the following rules of thumb from Tyler’s research:\n- 3% of prospects are ready to buy immediately\n- 7% are close to being ready to buy\n- 60% don’t yet know whether they want to buy — they need nurturing\n- 30% aren’t interested and won’t talk with you\nThe largest group of potentially-willing leads isn’t yet ready to buy, so in sales, pleasant and patient persistence wins.\nThe second-largest group knows they don’t want you (or will be deciding between you and a competitor), making them unlikely wins, so you need to continuously replenish your lists with high-quality leads.\n3. Framing conversations\nIf you manage to get a moment of your prospects’ time, you need to give some thought to the kind of conversation or content that’s got the best chance of success.\nMost of the highest-performing sales teams collect data about which conversations convert. While you may not have the volume to run statistically valid tests, generating an extensive list of potential conversations can increase your chances of finding one that works (just like coming up with a good article headline . . .).\nHere’s a simple way to generate just such a list. Firstly, write down the key topics your ICP cares about — this might include the specifics of their problem, their perceptions of your product, or even broader issues with the industry. As non-sales examples, potential employees might care a lot about company culture, perks, or a key industry trend.\nSecondly, you can ‘frame’ the conversation in terms of its strategic, financial, or personal impact. Using our fictitious conversation with an employee about company culture, you could frame it as:\n- The importance of culture in building a successful business (strategic)\n- The hidden costs of working in a toxic culture (financial)\n- The mental impact of working in a good culture (personal)\nFraming the conversation like this triples the number of topics you could discuss, but by defining the emotion you want to tap into, you can help generate even more topics. For example:\n- The importance of building a culture your team can be proud of (strategic)\n- The depressing costs of working in a toxic culture (financial)\n- The motivation that comes from a good culture (personal)\nOnce you have a long list of potential conversations, you can prioritise them based on estimated impact. If you have enough volume and you’re willing to standardise your approach, you can measure the effectiveness of different conversations on response or conversion rate.\nThat said, when you’re a team of one with a relatively small number of prospects, you may opt to personalise every email.\n4. Building message sequences\nAs I mentioned earlier, every follow-up increases the chance of getting a response. Tyler’s research suggests that eight reach-outs can increase the response rate from 3% to 28% — that’s nearly 10X the results.\nTherefore, you can think of cold reach-outs as a measurable sequence of emails, not just one — each one setting up a different conversation (from above). Sequences can be as complicated or as simple as you like. For example:\n- Day 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 and once monthly\n- Day 1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 11, 20 and once quarterly\n- Day 1, 1, 7, 7, 10, 10, and once every four months\nWriting good emails takes practice, and I can’t predict which emails will work for you. Common wisdom advises us to include emotional triggers in your subject; focus on a specific problem, outcome and call to action; and be as concise as possible (unless you really are Ernest Hemmingway… in which case write on!)\nThe call to action may be as simple as replying to the email, or setting up a quick call or meeting to continue the conversation.\nJust as cold emails follow a sequence, so do meetings. In recruiting, the meetings depend on your structured interview process; similarly, some investors have their own process for evaluating deals.\nAs for sales, Tyler suggests that a three-meeting sequence is enough to close simple deals:\n- Step 1: First Contact — to quickly figure out if it’s a waste of time (15 mins)\n- Step 2: Discovery Call — to figure out if there’s a fit (1 hour)\n- Step 3: Group Working Session — to build a common vision around working together (2 hours)\nThat’s 3 hours and 15 minutes to close a sale — assuming you’re successful. Yes, every form of selling takes a lot of time.\n5. Managing your time\nGiven the large number of tasks involved in sales development, many salespeople use the Pomodoro technique to organise their day into 25-minute work sprints, with each followed by a five-minute break. Scheduling in tasks — like writing emails, researching leads, and taking calls — ensures that they will happen, and batching them can increase efficiency.\nHere’s an example of what a sales rep’s calendar might look like:\nPlanning your schedule forces you to quantify how much time is needed to manage the pipeline — and it’s often more than you think.\nThat’s one reason why fundraising can take a founder out of the business for several months, and why recruiting often takes longer than most founders expect.\n6. Generating Referrals\nThis isn’t strictly prospecting, but it’s so frequently overlooked that I wanted to talk about it anyway. Conversion rates from referrals typically outperform every other channel, yet it’s the channel most companies spend the least amount of time on.\nThink about all the investors, customers, and network connections that interacted with your business last week. How many opportunities did you take to ask for a warm referral? Exactly… and that’s a lot of missed opportunities.\nWhether you’re looking for new customers, investors, or recruits, asking your existing network for referrals is a great starting point.\nMake it rain\nUnderstanding the approaches that sales teams take to build repeatable processes can help you close deals in areas beyond sales.
